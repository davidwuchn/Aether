## Why Aether

Every AI coding tool now has "agents." Most of them are the same thing repackaged — a loop that plans, executes, and checks. That's not a colony. That's one ant doing laps.

Aether is different because it's modeled on how **real ant colonies work**: no central brain, no single agent trying to be everything. Instead, 24 specialized workers self-organize around your goal. A Builder writes code. When it hits something unfamiliar, it doesn't guess — it spawns a Scout to research. When code lands, a Watcher spawns to verify. A Tracker hunts bugs. An Archaeologist digs through git history. They work in parallel, in waves, across phases.

**What actually makes this different:**

🐜 **Pheromone signals, not prompt engineering.** You steer the colony the way a queen steers ants — with signals, not instructions. Drop a FOCUS signal on "security" and every worker weighs it. Drop a REDIRECT on "no raw SQL" and it becomes a hard constraint. The colony adapts without you rewriting prompts.

🐜 **Memory that compounds.** Learnings from one build become instincts for the next. Instincts promote to QUEEN.md wisdom. High-confidence wisdom flows to the Hive Brain and crosses into other projects on your machine. Your colonies get smarter over time.

🐜 **Built to be fun.** You set a goal, the colony builds it. You steer with signals, not micromanagement. You watch workers spawn workers. You seal the colony when it's done and start a new one. It feels like tending a garden, not writing tickets.

```
/ant:focus "security"              # 🐜 "Pay attention here"
/ant:redirect "no jQuery"          # 🐜 "Don't do this"
/ant:feedback "prefer composition" # 🐜 "Adjust based on this"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive setup (recommended)
npx aether-colony

# Or install globally
npm install -g aether-colony
```

Then in your project:

```
/ant:lay-eggs            # Set up Aether (one-time)
/ant:init "Build X"      # Start a colony with a goal
/ant:plan                # Generate phased roadmap
/ant:run                 # Autopilot: build, verify, advance all phases
/ant:seal                # Done — archive the colony
```

Five commands from zero to shipped.
