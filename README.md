## The Problem

AI coding assistants work sequentially — one agent does everything: research, code, test, review. When it hits something complex, it either guesses or asks you. There's no specialization, no parallel work, no memory across sessions.

## The Solution

Aether brings **ant colony intelligence** to AI-assisted development. Instead of one AI doing everything, you get a colony of specialists that self-organize around your goal.

Workers spawn workers dynamically (max depth 3, max 10 per phase). When a Builder hits something complex, it spawns a Scout to research. When code is written, a Watcher spawns to verify. The colony adapts to the problem.

You steer the colony with **pheromone signals**, not micromanagement:

```
/ant:focus "security"              # "Pay attention here"
/ant:redirect "no jQuery"          # "Don't do this" (hard constraint)
/ant:feedback "prefer composition" # "Adjust based on this"
```

The colony **remembers**. Wisdom, learnings, and instincts persist across sessions. The Hive Brain shares knowledge across colonies on your machine.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g aether-colony

# In your project repo:
/ant:lay-eggs            # Set up Aether (one-time)
/ant:init "Build X"      # Start a colony with a goal
/ant:plan                # Generate phased roadmap
/ant:run                 # Autopilot: build, verify, advance all phases
/ant:seal                # Done — archive the colony
```

That's it. Five commands from zero to shipped.

## How It Works

 ├── Builders      write code (TDD-first)
 ├── Watchers      verify & test
 ├── Scouts        research docs and domains
 ├── Trackers      investigate bugs
 ├── Colonizers    explore codebases (4 parallel scouts)

Workers spawn workers dynamically (max depth 3, max 10 per phase). When a Builder hits something complex, it spawns a Scout to research. When code is written, a Watcher spawns to verify. The colony adapts to the problem.

## Key Features

- **24 Specialized Agents** — Real subagents spawned via Task tool, from builders to archaeologists
- **44 Slash Commands** — Full lifecycle management across Claude Code and OpenCode
- **Pheromone System** — Guide the colony with FOCUS, REDIRECT, FEEDBACK signals
- **Colony Memory** — Learnings persist across sessions via QUEEN.md wisdom
- **Hive Brain** — Cross-colony wisdom sharing with domain-scoped retrieval
- **Skills System** — 28 skills (10 colony + 18 domain) inject domain knowledge into workers
- **Autopilot** (`/ant:run`) — Automated build-verify-advance loop with smart pause conditions
- **6-Phase Verification** — Build, types, lint, tests, security, diff gates before any phase advances
- **Quality Gates** — Security (Gatekeeper), quality (Auditor), coverage (Probe), performance (Measurer)
- **Per-Phase Research** — Scouts investigate domain knowledge before task decomposition
- **Oracle Deep Research** — Autonomous research loop for complex investigations
- **Pause/Resume** — Full state serialization for context breaks
