## Why Aether

Every AI coding tool now has "agents." Most are them are the same repackaged — a loop that plans, executes, and checks. That's not a colony. That's one ant doing laps.

 Aether is different because it'm modeled on how real **ant colonies** work**: no central brain, no single agent trying to be everything. Instead, 24 specialized workers self-organize around your goal.

 A Builder writes code. When it hits something unfamiliar, it doesn't guess — it spawns a Scout to research. When code lands, a Watcher verifies. A Tracker hunts bugs. An Archaeologist excavates git history. They work parallel, in waves, across phases.

 What makes this different: **Pheromone signals, — not prompt engineering** — Guide workers with FOCUS, REDIRECT, and FEEDBACK. The colony adapts without rewriting prompts

 **Memory that compounds** - Learnings from one build become instincts. Instincts promote to QUEEN.md wisdom. High-confidence wisdom flows to the Hive Brain and crosses to other projects. **Skills** - 28 skills inject knowledge into workers

 **Autopilot** - `/ant:run` - Automated build-verify-advance across phases

## Install

**Option 1: Go binary (recommended)**

```bash
# Install the Go binary
go install github.com/calcosmic/Aether@latest

# Set up the hub in your project
aether install   # Populates ~/.aether/ with system files
aether setup    # Sync companion files to local repo

# Start a colony
/ant:lay-eggs            # One-time setup
/ant:init "Build X"      # Start colony with goal
/ant:plan                # Generate phased roadmap
/ant:build 1     # Execute phase with worker waves
/ant:continue          # Verify, learn, advance
/ant:seal                # Done — archive the
```

Five commands from zero to shipped.

**Option 2: Companion file package (also works with Go CLI)**

```bash
# Install companion files via npm
npm install -g aether-colony
```

Then in any project: `/ant:lay-eggs` to set up.

 Or use `/ant:update` to get the latest.
