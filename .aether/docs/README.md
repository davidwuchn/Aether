# Aether Documentation

This directory contains actively maintained documentation for the Aether colony system.

Runtime/behavior authority remains in:
- `aether` CLI binary (Go implementation in `cmd/`)
- `.claude/commands/ant/*.md` (command flow)

Docs in this directory are explanatory references and should not override runtime behavior.

Distribution note:
- `aether update` does not sync repo-local session files like `.aether/CONTEXT.md` and `.aether/HANDOFF.md`.
