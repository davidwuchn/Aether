# Aether Documentation

This directory contains actively maintained documentation for the Aether colony system.

Runtime/behavior authority remains in:
- `aether` CLI binary (Go implementation in `cmd/`)
- `AGENTS.md` + `.codex/CODEX.md` + `.codex/agents/*.toml` (Codex direct CLI surface)
- `.claude/commands/ant/*.md` and `.opencode/commands/ant/*.md` (slash-command surfaces)

Codex release note:
- `aether run`, `aether watch`, and `aether oracle` are part of the shipped
  Codex CLI surface.
- `aether update` now also refreshes Aether-managed `AGENTS.md` and
  `.codex/CODEX.md` in target repos so literal `aether ...` commands keep using
  the live CLI workflow instead of stale repo guidance.

Docs in this directory are explanatory references and should not override runtime behavior.

Distribution note:
- `aether update` does not sync repo-local session files like `.aether/CONTEXT.md` and `.aether/HANDOFF.md`.
- `aether update` also does not rebuild the local `aether` runtime unless `--download-binary` is explicitly used.
- Unreleased local runtime fixes propagate on a machine through `aether install --package-dir <Aether checkout>` in the Aether source repo, not through plain `aether update`.

## Archived Docs

Historical documentation moved to `archive/` subdirectory:

- `QUEEN_ANT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - superseded by agent files
- `implementation-learnings.md` - historical findings
- `constraints.md` - content now in agent definitions
- `pathogen-schema.md` - specialized use case
- `pathogen-schema-example.json` - example for schema
- `progressive-disclosure.md` - design philosophy

Archived docs remain available for reference but are not actively maintained.
