# Ceremony Revival v1.6 Handoff

Last updated: 2026-04-24T12:14:23Z

Branch: `codex/ceremony-lifecycle-events-v16`
Base: `origin/main` after merged PR #7
Previous PR: `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether/pull/5` (merged/closed; covered only the early branch state through `c1880184`)
Merged PRs: `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether/pull/6`, `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether/pull/7`
Open PR: `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether/pull/8` (draft; not merged)

## Purpose

This handoff preserves the exact implementation plan for finishing the v1.6
ceremony revival if the current session loses context.

The target architecture is:

- Go owns colony state, dispatch contracts, event persistence, and lifecycle
  safety.
- The bundled TypeScript narrator owns rich ceremony rendering.
- Claude Code and OpenCode wrappers own real Task-tool subagent spawning.
- Codex remains a direct CLI surface and must not claim Task-tool work happened
  inside Go.

Do not revert the Go runtime rewrite. Restore ceremony and real agent spawning
on top of the current runtime.

## Progress Source Of Truth

There are two separate progress tracks in this checkout:

1. **Lifecycle state**: `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json` still reports
   `current_phase: 1` with all seven phases pending. Treat that as colony
   lifecycle state only. Do not manually edit it to match code progress.
2. **Branch implementation progress**: git commits plus this tracked handoff are
   the source of truth for what has actually been implemented on
   `codex/ceremony-lifecycle-events-v16`.

This mismatch is expected for this branch because implementation slices were
committed directly while the persisted colony lifecycle was not advanced through
`aether build` / `aether continue`.

## Progress Matrix

| Area | Status | Evidence | Remaining Work |
|------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Phase 1: assumptions and gap audit | Done in practice, stale in colony state | `.aether/docs/ceremony-revival-v1.6-plan.md`, this handoff, review synthesis | Only update lifecycle state through normal Aether commands if needed |
| Phase 2: event protocol and narrator foundations | Implemented | `.aether/ts`, `pkg/events/ceremony.go`, `event-bus-subscribe --stream`, `visuals-dump`, install/update tests | None known beyond release verification |
| Phase 3: rolling activity display | Implemented foundation | `.aether/ts/narrator.ts`, multi-wave activity tests, `dist/narrator.js` | TTY live redraw/debounce deferred until real terminal contract is clear |
| Phase 4: build subagent bridge | Implemented for wrappers | `build --plan-only`, `build-finalize`, manifest `execution_plan`, Claude/OpenCode build wrappers, wrapper contract tests | Live platform smoke and any future specialist prompt polish |
| Phase 5: continue and plan orchestration | Implemented for wrappers | `continue --plan-only`, `continue-finalize`, `plan --plan-only`, `plan-finalize`, wrapper contract tests | Live platform smoke; stall/confidence ceremony polish |
| Phase 6: full lifecycle ceremony and skills | Partially implemented | Build ceremony emits from Go; TS renders generic lifecycle stages and context notices; Go emits pheromone/chamber plus plan/colonize/continue wave events | Emit skill activation and remaining QUEEN/Hive/midden/graveyard context from real state |
| Phase 7: parity verification and release | Not done | Release/rollback notes exist | Cross-platform smoke, install/update release checks, PR review, release hardening |

Safe continuation point: PR #6 and PR #7 are merged. PR #8 is still open as a
draft for `codex/ceremony-lifecycle-events-v16`; it is not on `main` yet.
The old `codex/ceremony-narrator-foundation-v16` branch still appears on
GitHub because PR #7 was merged without deleting its source branch. Go-side
wrapper smoke passed for `build 1 --plan-only`; true Claude/OpenCode Task-tool
smoke remains pending because Codex cannot execute those platform Task-tool
wrappers directly. The current working-tree slice continues Phase 6 Go-backed
lifecycle ceremony emission for plan, colonize, and continue wave events.

Implemented foundation:

- `.aether/ts/` exists with strict TypeScript source and tests.
- `.aether/ts/dist/narrator.js` is committed as the dependency-free Node runtime.
- Install/update packaging syncs `.aether/ts` and excludes `node_modules`.
- CI/release/dependabot cover the narrator package and dist drift.
- Ceremony event topic and payload types live in `pkg/events/ceremony.go`.
- `aether event-bus-subscribe --stream --filter ceremony.*` streams persisted
  event-bus entries as NDJSON.
- `aether visuals-dump --json` exposes Go-owned caste emoji/color/label
  metadata.
- The narrator accepts Go visual metadata via `--visuals`.
- A Go smoke test pipes event-bus stream output through `dist/narrator.js`.
- Go can now auto-launch the narrator sidecar for build ceremony events.
- Build dispatch lifecycle events are persisted to `event-bus.jsonl` even in
  JSON mode.
- `AETHER_NARRATOR` launch gating is implemented with JSON mode protected from
  narrator text.
- The narrator now keeps an in-memory activity frame and renders worker
  sections for active, completed, blocked, and other workers.
- Temporary HOME smoke verified the source-built binary can launch the narrator
  from the installed hub fallback when the fixture repo has no local
  `.aether/ts` runtime.
- `aether build <phase> --plan-only` now prints a machine-readable
  `dispatch_manifest` without changing colony state, writing checkpoints,
  writing worker briefs, writing claims, or spawning workers.
- Plan-only dispatch entries include the intended caste, deterministic worker
  name, `agent_name`, wave/task metadata, and `planned` status so wrappers can
  spawn real Task-tool agents from JSON instead of scraping visual output.
- `aether build-finalize <phase> --completion-file <path|->` records externally
  spawned wrapper Task results as the build manifest and claims packet that
  `aether continue` already trusts.
- Claude/OpenCode build wrappers now spawn real manifest-driven Task/subagents
  and finalize through `build-finalize`.
- `aether continue --plan-only` emits a read-only `continue_manifest` for
  wrapper-spawned Watcher/Gatekeeper/Auditor/Probe review.
- `aether continue-finalize --completion-file <path|->` merges wrapper review
  results, re-runs deterministic verification, writes reports, and advances or
  blocks through runtime gates.
- Claude/OpenCode continue wrappers now spawn real manifest-driven review
  agents and finalize through `continue-finalize`.
- `aether plan --plan-only --depth <fast|balanced|deep|exhaustive>` now emits a
  read-only `plan_manifest` / `planning_manifest` for wrapper-spawned Scout and
  Route-Setter agents.
- `aether plan-finalize --completion-file <path|->` records externally spawned
  Scout/Route-Setter results as the canonical colony plan and planning
  artifacts.
- Claude/OpenCode plan wrappers now prompt for depth, spawn real
  manifest-driven Scout/Route-Setter agents, and finalize through
  `plan-finalize`.
- Build manifests now include a runtime-owned `execution_plan` plus
  per-dispatch `execution_wave`. Full builds sequence pre-wave specialists
  before builder/scout waves and post-wave specialists after them:
  Archaeologist, Oracle, Architect, conditional Ambassador, task waves, Probe,
  Watcher, Measurer, and Chaos. Task-scoped redispatch remains narrow and skips
  full-phase specialists.

Verification already passed for the pushed foundation:

- `npm --prefix .aether/ts audit --package-lock-only --audit-level=low`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts run build`
- `git diff --exit-code -- .aether/ts/dist/narrator.js`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts run typecheck`

- `go test ./... -race -count=1 -timeout 600s`
- `go vet ./...`
- `git diff --check`

## Specialist Review Synthesis

Scout mapped the build dispatch path:

- CLI entry is `cmd/codex_workflow_cmds.go`; `buildCmd` calls
  `runCodexBuild`.
- Build orchestration is `cmd/codex_build.go`; it plans dispatches, writes
  artifacts, records spawn-tree entries, emits the preview, then calls
  `executeCodexBuildDispatches`.
- Runtime execution is custom in `cmd/codex_build_worktree.go` because worktree
  allocation, sync, and claim collection live there.
- Progress helpers are centralized in `cmd/codex_build_progress.go`.
- Do not route build through the generic `pkg/codex.DispatchBatchWithObserver`
  yet; that would be a broader refactor.

Watcher identified launcher tests:

- Cover `AETHER_NARRATOR=off`, `auto`, `on`, JSON mode, missing Node, missing
  runtime, early runtime exit, child cleanup, event persistence, and command
  output not being polluted.
- Add injection seams for `exec.LookPath`, runtime path resolution, and process
  start so tests are not brittle.
- Avoid writing child stdout directly to the shared `stdout` writer because
  tests often replace it with `bytes.Buffer`.

Gatekeeper guardrails:

- Use `exec.CommandContext` with absolute `node` and absolute
  `dist/narrator.js` paths.
- Never use shell, `npm`, `npx`, package scripts, or `narrator.ts` at runtime.
- Missing Node or missing runtime must be non-fatal.
- Pipe child stdout back through Go and write using the existing visual output
  mutex path.
- Add length caps/truncation for event fields before rendering or forwarding
  large payloads.
- Keep `node_modules` out of install/update/release artifacts.

Existing non-narrator dependency advisories were noted by Gatekeeper but not
changed in this slice. They should be handled as a separate release-hardening
task, not mixed into the launcher.

## Completed Slice: Build Plan-Only Manifest

Purpose:

- Give Claude Code and OpenCode wrappers a safe machine-readable dispatch
  contract before restoring real Task-tool spawning.
- Keep Go authoritative for phase/task/wave planning while keeping wrapper
  execution outside the Go binary.
- Avoid the unsafe fallback of parsing the visual spawn plan.

Implemented behavior:

- `aether build <phase> --plan-only` validates the requested phase, task filter,
  critical pre-build gates, and build order using the same checks as a real
  build.
- The command returns JSON with `plan_only: true`, `dispatch_mode: "plan-only"`,
  top-level `dispatches`, and a structured `dispatch_manifest`.
- The manifest includes phase metadata, root, colony depth, parallel mode, wave
  execution strategy, playbooks, task plans, success criteria, selected tasks,
  and planned dispatches.
- Dispatch maps include `agent_name` values such as `aether-builder` and
  `aether-watcher` for wrapper Task-tool routing.
- The command does not call the worker invoker, does not publish ceremony
  events, does not update `COLONY_STATE.json`, does not update session context,
  and does not write build/checkpoint/claim artifacts.

Focused verification:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestBuildPlanOnly|TestBuildWritesDispatchArtifactsAndUpdatesState|TestBuildSupportsTaskScopedRedispatch' -count=1`

Important limitation:

- This is only the planning half of the wrapper bridge unless paired with
  `aether build-finalize`. Do not make wrappers call a fake `aether build
  --synthetic` after real Task work; that would overwrite the evidence trail
  with simulated dispatch.

## Completed Slice: Build Finalize For Wrapper Agents

Architect review confirmed the missing contract:

- `spawn-log` and `spawn-complete` are visibility only.
- `aether continue` trusts `.aether/data/build/phase-N/manifest.json` and
  `.aether/data/last-build-claims.json`.
- Therefore wrappers need one Go-owned finalization packet after real Task-tool
  execution, not fake `aether build` execution.

Implemented behavior:

- New command: `aether build-finalize <phase> --completion-file <path|->`.
- Completion JSON must include the original `dispatch_manifest` from
  `aether build --plan-only` plus terminal worker results.
- The finalizer validates phase/state/task filters, manifest identity, dispatch
  identity, terminal statuses, and critical pre-build gates.
- It writes:
  - `.aether/data/checkpoints/pre-build-phase-N.json`
  - `.aether/data/build/phase-N/manifest.json` with
    `dispatch_mode: "external-task"` and terminal dispatch statuses
  - `.aether/data/last-build-claims.json`, either from explicit claims or
    aggregated completed worker file/test claims
  - `spawn-tree.txt` entries/statuses if wrappers did not already record them
- It sets colony state to `BUILT`, keeps the phase `in_progress`, and points the
  next action at `aether continue`.

Expected wrapper flow:

1. `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether build <phase> --plan-only`
2. Parse `result.dispatch_manifest`
3. For each dispatch wave, call `spawn-log`, spawn the matching Task/subagent,
   then call `spawn-complete`
4. Write a completion JSON file containing the original `dispatch_manifest` and
   the worker results/claims
5. `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether build-finalize <phase> --completion-file <file>`
6. `aether continue`

Focused verification:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestBuildPlanOnly|TestBuildFinalizeRecordsExternalTaskResultsForContinue' -count=1`

## Completed Slice: Build Wrapper Restoration

Claude/OpenCode build wrappers now use the bridge instead of the old
pass-through contract.

Changed files:

- `.aether/commands/build.yaml`
- `.claude/commands/ant/build.md`
- `.opencode/commands/ant/build.md`
- `.aether/docs/wrapper-runtime-ux-contract.md`
- `cmd/build_wrapper_ceremony_test.go`
- `cmd/platform_doc_hygiene_test.go`

Wrapper flow now required:

1. Ground with `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether status`.
2. Request the authoritative plan with
   `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether build $ARGUMENTS --plan-only`.
3. Parse `result.dispatch_manifest`.
4. Load `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-wave.md`.
5. Spawn real platform agents using `subagent_type="{agent_name}"` or the
   platform equivalent, with names/castes/waves/tasks from the manifest.
6. Call `aether spawn-log` before each worker and `aether spawn-complete` after.
7. Write a completion JSON file outside `.aether/data/`.
8. Run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether build-finalize $ARGUMENTS
   --completion-file <file>`.
9. Route to `/ant-continue`.

Important guardrails now enforced:

- Wrappers must not run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether build $ARGUMENTS`.
- Wrappers must not run `aether build --synthetic` after real agents finish.
- Wrappers must not invent castes, waves, or names.
- Wrappers must not parse visual output as truth.

Focused verification:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestBuildWrapperCeremonyContract|TestPlatformDocHygiene|TestClaudeOpenCodeCommandParity|TestCommandWrappersDeclareGeneratedSource' -count=1`

## Completed Slice: Continue Plan-Only Manifest

Architect review confirmed the continue bridge should mirror build:

- Keep normal `aether continue` as the direct Codex/runtime compatibility path.
- Add `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether continue --plan-only` for wrappers.
- Add `continue-finalize` next; do not trust `spawn-log` / `spawn-complete` as
  advancement evidence.
- Finalization must re-run deterministic verification and claim checks before
  advancing. It must not trust stale plan-only output.

Implemented in this slice:

- `aether continue --plan-only` runs runtime-owned verification commands and
  claim checks, but does not mutate state, does not write reports, and does not
  spawn Go-side workers.
- It emits `result.continue_manifest` with:
  - phase/root metadata
  - verification snapshot
  - assessment snapshot
  - planned wrapper workers: Watcher, Gatekeeper, Auditor, Probe
  - worker names, castes, `agent_name`, waves, task IDs, status `planned`, and
    rendered worker briefs
  - `finalize_surface: "pending"` as the wrapper handoff marker

Focused verification:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestContinuePlanOnlyPrintsReviewManifestWithoutMutatingState' -count=1`

Next exact slice:

- Add `aether continue-finalize --completion-file <path|->`.
- It should re-load current state, re-run verification/claims, merge wrapper
  watcher/review results, run the existing gate/assessment path, then use the
  existing atomic advancement/report/session update logic.

## Completed Slice: Continue Finalize For Wrapper Agents

Implemented in this slice:

- New command: `aether continue-finalize --completion-file <path|->`.
- Completion JSON must include the original `continue_manifest` from
  `aether continue --plan-only` plus terminal wrapper worker results.
- The finalizer re-loads current state and rejects stale phase mismatch.
- It re-runs runtime-owned verification commands and build-claim checks at
  finalization time.
- It merges the external Watcher result into the verification report.
- It merges external Gatekeeper/Auditor/Probe results into the review report.
- It writes:
  - `.aether/data/build/phase-N/verification.json`
  - `.aether/data/build/phase-N/gates.json`
  - `.aether/data/build/phase-N/review.json`
  - `.aether/data/build/phase-N/continue.json`
- It records/updates spawn-tree entries for wrapper continue workers without
  duplicating entries when wrappers already called `spawn-log`.
- It uses the existing gate, assessment, housekeeping, context, and atomic
  advancement behavior to move to the next phase or block safely.

Expected continue wrapper flow:

1. `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether continue --plan-only`
2. Parse `result.continue_manifest`
3. Spawn Watcher first, then Gatekeeper/Auditor/Probe from the manifest
4. Call `aether spawn-log` before each worker and `aether spawn-complete` after
5. Write a completion JSON file outside `.aether/data/`
6. `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether continue-finalize --completion-file <file>`
7. Route based on the finalizer's runtime result

Focused verification:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestContinuePlanOnly|TestContinueFinalizeRecordsExternalReviewAndAdvances' -count=1`

## Completed Slice: Continue Wrapper Restoration

Claude/OpenCode continue wrappers now use the continue bridge instead of the old
visual pass-through contract.

Changed files:

- `.aether/commands/continue.yaml`
- `.claude/commands/ant/continue.md`
- `.opencode/commands/ant/continue.md`
- `cmd/continue_wrapper_ceremony_test.go`
- `cmd/platform_doc_hygiene_test.go`
- `cmd/codex_visuals.go`

Wrapper flow now required:

1. Ground with `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether status`.
2. Request the authoritative plan with
   `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether continue --plan-only $ARGUMENTS`.
3. Parse `result.continue_manifest`.
4. Spawn Watcher first from wave 1.
5. Spawn Gatekeeper, Auditor, and Probe from wave 2; these can run in parallel
   when the platform supports it.
6. Call `aether spawn-log` before each worker and `aether spawn-complete` after.
7. Write a completion JSON file outside `.aether/data/`.
8. Run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether continue-finalize --completion-file
   <file>`.
9. Route from the finalizer result to `/ant-build N+1`, `/ant-continue`, or
   `/ant-seal`.

Important guardrails now enforced:

- Wrappers must not run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether continue $ARGUMENTS`.
- Wrappers must not run direct non-plan-only `aether continue`.
- Wrappers must not invent castes, waves, or names.
- Wrappers must not parse visual output as truth.
- The normal direct `aether continue` path remains available for Codex/direct
  CLI compatibility.

Focused verification:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestContinueWrapperCeremonyContract|TestPlatformCommandDocsAvoidLegacyShellRuntime|TestContinuePlanOnly|TestContinueFinalizeRecordsExternalReviewAndAdvances' -count=1`

## Completed Slice: Plan Plan-Only Manifest

Architect review confirmed the plan bridge should mirror build/continue:

- Keep normal `aether plan` as the direct Codex/runtime compatibility path.
- Add a read-only manifest surface for Claude/OpenCode wrappers.
- Preserve one Go-owned planning-depth mapping instead of inventing a separate
  wrapper-only depth system.
- Add `plan-finalize` next; wrappers should not write `.aether/data/planning`
  as the authority path.

Implemented in this slice:

- `aether plan --plan-only --depth <fast|balanced|deep|exhaustive>` runs the
  same plan preflight checks but does not mutate state, write planning
  artifacts, update session context, record spawn-tree entries, or spawn
  Go-side planning workers.
- Depth maps to existing plan granularity:
  - fast -> sprint (1-3 phases)
  - balanced -> milestone (4-7 phases)
  - deep -> quarter (8-12 phases)
  - exhaustive -> major (13-20 phases)
- The command emits both `result.plan_manifest` and `result.planning_manifest`
  for wrapper compatibility.
- The manifest includes:
  - goal/root/generated_at
  - depth and granularity bounds
  - survey context
  - dispatch contract
  - two planned workers: Scout wave 1 and Route-Setter wave 2
  - worker names, castes, `agent_name`, waves, task IDs, status `planned`, and
    rendered worker briefs
  - `finalize_surface: "pending"` and `requires_finalizer: true`
- Existing plans without `--refresh` return `existing_plan: true` and
  `requires_finalizer: false`, preserving the direct "use current plan" path.

Expected plan wrapper flow after the next slices:

1. Ground with `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether status`.
2. Ask the user for planning depth: Fast, Balanced, Deep, or Exhaustive.
3. Run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether plan --plan-only --depth <choice>`.
4. Parse `result.plan_manifest` or `result.planning_manifest`.
5. Spawn Scout from wave 1.
6. Spawn Route-Setter from wave 2 with Scout findings and the exact
   `phase-plan.json` schema.
7. Call `aether spawn-log` before each worker and `aether spawn-complete` after.
8. Write a completion JSON file outside `.aether/data/`.
9. Run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether plan-finalize --completion-file <file>`.
10. Route from the finalizer result to `/ant-build 1` or a runtime-surfaced
    recovery command.

Plan-finalize contract for the next worker:

- New command: `aether plan-finalize --completion-file <path|->`.
- Completion JSON should include the original `plan_manifest`/`planning_manifest`
  and terminal worker results.
- Prefer embedded completion data as authority:
  - Scout result: `summary`, sourced `findings`, `gaps`, optional `scout_report`
  - Route-Setter result: `phase_plan` matching `codexWorkerPlanArtifact`
- Support claimed file fallback only after validation.
- Re-load current state and reject stale goal/state/refresh conflicts.
- Validate dispatch identities by name/caste/wave/task_id.
- Write canonical planning artifacts:
  - `.aether/data/planning/SCOUT.md`
  - `.aether/data/planning/ROUTE-SETTER.md`
  - `.aether/data/planning/phase-plan.json`
  - `.aether/data/phase-research/phase-N-research.md`
- Update spawn tree/run status for wrapper workers without duplicating
  `spawn-log` entries.
- Update `COLONY_STATE.json`: `READY`, first buildable phase, selected
  granularity, generated plan/confidence, `build_started_at: nil`, and planning
  events.
- Update session/CONTEXT/HANDOFF through existing runtime helpers.

## Completed Slice: Plan Finalize For Wrapper Agents

Implemented in this slice:

- New command: `aether plan-finalize --completion-file <path|->`.
- Completion JSON must include the original `plan_manifest` or
  `planning_manifest` from `aether plan --plan-only` plus terminal wrapper
  worker results.
- The finalizer re-loads current state and rejects stale goal mismatches,
  invalid granularity, non-refresh replacement of an existing plan, and refresh
  attempts after completed phases.
- It validates dispatch identity by name/caste/stage/wave/task_id.
- It requires completed Scout and Route-Setter results.
- Route-Setter must provide `phase_plan` matching the existing
  `codexWorkerPlanArtifact` JSON shape, either embedded in the completion packet
  or as a validated claimed `.aether/data/planning/phase-plan.json` fallback.
- It writes canonical runtime-owned artifacts:
  - `.aether/data/planning/SCOUT.md`
  - `.aether/data/planning/ROUTE-SETTER.md`
  - `.aether/data/planning/phase-plan.json`
  - `.aether/data/phase-research/phase-N-research.md`
- It records/updates spawn-tree entries for wrapper planning workers without
  duplicating entries when wrappers already called `spawn-log`.
- It updates `COLONY_STATE.json` to `READY`, first buildable phase, selected
  plan granularity, generated plan/confidence, `build_started_at: nil`, and
  planning events.
- It updates session/CONTEXT/HANDOFF through existing runtime helpers.

Expected plan wrapper flow now:

1. Ground with `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether status`.
2. Ask the user for planning depth: Fast, Balanced, Deep, or Exhaustive.
3. Run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether plan --plan-only --depth <choice>`.
4. Parse `result.plan_manifest` or `result.planning_manifest`.
5. Spawn Scout from wave 1.
6. Spawn Route-Setter from wave 2 with Scout findings and the exact
   `phase-plan.json` schema.
7. Call `aether spawn-log` before each worker and `aether spawn-complete` after.
8. Write a completion JSON file outside `.aether/data/`.
9. Run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether plan-finalize --completion-file <file>`.
10. Route from the finalizer result to `/ant-build 1` or a runtime-surfaced
    recovery command.

## Completed Slice: Plan Wrapper Restoration

Claude/OpenCode plan wrappers now use the planning bridge instead of the old
direct visual pass-through contract.

- `.claude/commands/ant/plan.md`
- `.opencode/commands/ant/plan.md`
- `cmd/plan_wrapper_ceremony_test.go`

2. Ground with `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether status`.
3. Request the authoritative manifest with
   `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether plan --plan-only --depth <choice>`.
4. Parse `result.plan_manifest` or `result.planning_manifest`.
5. Spawn Scout from wave 1.
6. Spawn Route-Setter from wave 2, requiring a `phase_plan` payload matching the
   existing `phase-plan.json` schema.
7. Call `aether spawn-log` before each worker and `aether spawn-complete` after.
8. Write a completion JSON file outside `.aether/data/`.
9. Run `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether plan-finalize --completion-file <file>`.
10. Route to `/ant-build 1` or the runtime-surfaced next build command.

Important guardrails now enforced:

- Wrappers must not run direct `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether plan
  $ARGUMENTS`.
- Wrappers must not run direct non-plan-only `aether plan`.
- Wrappers must not run `aether plan --synthetic` after real agents finish.
- Wrappers must not invent Scout/Route-Setter names, castes, waves, or task IDs.
- Wrappers must not write `.aether/data/planning` as the authority path.
- Direct `aether plan` remains available for Codex/direct CLI compatibility.

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestPlanWrapperCeremonyContract|TestPlatformCommandDocsAvoidLegacyShellRuntime|TestClaudeOpenCodeCommandParity|TestCommandWrappersDeclareGeneratedSource' -count=1`

Watcher audit notes before flipping `/ant-plan` wrappers:

- Add `plan-finalize` first. The wrappers must not move to manifest-driven
  orchestration while the finalizer surface is missing.
- Add `TestPlanWrapperCeremonyContract` before editing `.claude`/`.opencode`
  plan markdown. It should require the depth prompt, JSON `plan --plan-only
  --depth`, `result.plan_manifest` / `result.planning_manifest`, Scout wave 1,
  Route-Setter wave 2, spawn-log/spawn-complete, completion JSON outside
  `.aether/data`, and `plan-finalize`.
- Preserve direct CLI compatibility explicitly: direct `aether plan --depth
  deep` must still generate and persist a plan without `plan_only`, without
  `requires_finalizer`, and with `next: aether build N`.
- Extend plan-only non-mutation coverage whenever finalizer work touches nearby
  state paths. Current coverage checks planning dirs, phase research, spawn tree,
  session, event bus, runtime spawn-run files, CONTEXT, HANDOFF, and colony plan
  state.

Plan wrapper rollback note:

- If plan wrapper orchestration misbehaves, revert only `.aether/commands/plan.yaml`,
  `.claude/commands/ant/plan.md`, `.opencode/commands/ant/plan.md`, and their
  wrapper contract tests back to direct `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether plan`.
- Keep direct `aether plan` unchanged throughout; this remains the fallback
  runtime path for Codex/direct CLI users.
- Do not roll back build/continue bridges unless their own tests regress.

## Completed Slice: Go Narrator Launcher

### Files To Add Or Edit

- Added `cmd/narrator_launcher.go`
- Added `cmd/ceremony_emitter.go`
- Added `cmd/narrator_launcher_test.go`
- Added `cmd/ceremony_emitter_test.go`
- Edited `cmd/codex_build.go`
- Edited `cmd/codex_build_worktree.go`
- Edited `cmd/testing_main_test.go`

### Runtime Policy

Safe output policy:

- `AETHER_NARRATOR=off`: never launch.
- `AETHER_NARRATOR=auto` or unset: launch only when visual output is enabled.
- `AETHER_NARRATOR=on`: force launch in visual/human output, but still do not
  launch when `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json`.
- `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json`: no narrator stdout under any mode. JSON output must
  stay machine-parseable.

If a future release wants narrator data during JSON mode, add an explicit
stderr/file sink. Do not silently mix `[CEREMONY]` lines into JSON envelopes.

Failure policy:

- Missing Node is non-fatal.
- Missing `.aether/ts/dist/narrator.js` is non-fatal.
- Runtime start failure is non-fatal.
- Broken pipe or early narrator exit is non-fatal.
- Event publish failures are non-fatal for the build command; they should be
  test-visible but must not lose user work.

### Launcher Shape

`cmd/narrator_launcher.go` should provide:

```go
type narratorLauncher struct {
    // Owns the process, stdin pipe, stdout scanner, visual metadata temp file,
    // and cancellation.
}
```

Implemented behavior:

- Resolve `node` with an injectable `lookPath`.
- Resolve the runtime as an absolute path:
  - prefer `<repo root>/.aether/ts/dist/narrator.js`;
  - optionally fallback to `<hub>/system/ts/dist/narrator.js` if repo-local
    runtime is absent.
- Write a temporary visuals JSON envelope from `casteVisualContracts()` and pass
  it as `--visuals <path>`.
- Start `node dist/narrator.js --visuals <path>` with `exec.CommandContext`.
- Pipe event JSON lines to child stdin.
- Read child stdout in Go and call `writeVisualOutput(stdout, line+"\n")`.
- Drain child stderr without spamming command output.
- `Close()` closes stdin, waits, cancels if needed, waits for stdout drain,
  removes the temp visuals file, and is idempotent.

Do not call `event-bus-subscribe` from the parent build path. The Go process has
the events in hand; feed the sidecar directly through stdin. Keep
`event-bus-subscribe --stream` as a CLI/manual bridge and test fixture.

### Ceremony Emitter Shape

`cmd/ceremony_emitter.go` should provide a build-scoped emitter:

```go
type buildCeremonyEmitter struct {
    bus      *events.Bus
    narrator *narratorLauncher
    phaseID int
    phaseName string
}
```

Implemented behavior:

- Publish `events.CeremonyPayload` to `pkg/events.Bus` when `store` is
  available.
- Forward the exact persisted `events.Event` JSON to the narrator sidecar.
- If persistence fails, synthesize an event for the narrator only and continue.
- Protect the active emitter with a small mutex.
- Use a package-level active emitter only for the duration of `runCodexBuild`;
  it is restored with `defer`.
- Trim user-controlled event text and lists before persistence/forwarding.

### Build Event Insertion Points

Implemented phase-level events in `runCodexBuild`:

- After dispatches are planned and named: `ceremony.build.prewave`
  - include `phase`, `phase_name`, `total`, and success criteria count.
- Before worker execution starts, make the emitter active.
- After dispatch execution completes, close the launcher before final JSON/visual
  workflow output is written.

Implemented worker-level events in `cmd/codex_build_worktree.go`:

- Before each wave starts: `ceremony.build.wave.start`
  - include `phase`, `phase_name`, `wave`, `total`, message with execution
    strategy.
- On context-cancel before worker start: `ceremony.build.spawn`
  - status `timeout`, include worker identity and task id.
- On worktree allocation failure: `ceremony.build.spawn`
  - status `failed`, include blocker text.
- Immediately before invoking a worker: `ceremony.build.spawn`
  - status `starting`, include caste/name/task/task_id/spawn_id.
- In `invokeCodexWorkerWithRuntimeProgress`: `ceremony.build.tool_use`
  - status `running`, include message if present.
- After worker result: `ceremony.build.spawn`
  - status from result, include blockers, files created/modified, tests, tool
    count, and duration if available.
- After each wave finishes: `ceremony.build.wave.end`
  - include `completed`, `total`, and blocker count/message.

Scout's recommended narrow insertion points:

- `cmd/codex_build_worktree.go` wave start around the existing calls to
  `emitCodexBuildWaveProgress`.
- worker start around the existing calls to `emitCodexBuildWorkerStarted`.
- running progress inside `invokeCodexWorkerWithRuntimeProgress`.
- worker finish around the existing calls to `emitCodexBuildWorkerFinished`.

### Launcher Tests Added

- `TestNarratorLauncherOffSuppressesLaunch`
- `TestNarratorLauncherAutoSkipsJSONMode`
- `TestNarratorLauncherOnSkipsJSONMode`
- `TestNarratorLauncherAutoSkipsWhenNodeMissing`
- `TestNarratorLauncherMissingRuntimeDoesNotFail`
- `TestNarratorLauncherOnStreamsCeremonyEventsToBundledRuntime`
- `TestNarratorLauncherKeepsEventJSONLPersistence`
- `TestNarratorLauncherCloseCancelsStreamAndWaitsForRuntime`
- `TestNarratorLauncherHandlesEarlyRuntimeExit`
- `TestBuildSyntheticNarratorDoesNotPolluteJSONOutput`
- `TestNarratorLauncherUsesDistRuntimeDirectly` proves runtime launch uses
  `dist/narrator.js` and does not invoke `npm`, `npx`, `tsx`, or `narrator.ts`.
- `TestBuildCeremonyEmitterPersistsAndForwardsEvents`
- `TestBuildCeremonyEmitterTrimsUserControlledPayload`
- `TestActiveBuildCeremonyScopeRestoresPreviousEmitter`

Command-level JSON smoke should use a synthetic build fixture and assert:

- stdout is a valid `{"ok":true,"result":...}` or `{"ok":false,...}` envelope;
- stdout does not contain `[CEREMONY]`;
- event-bus JSONL still contains ceremony events if the build reached dispatch.

## Completed Slice: Rolling Activity Display Foundation

The first rolling display slice is implemented in `.aether/ts/narrator.ts`.
The narrator preserves the compatibility event line, then renders a stateful
`COLONY ACTIVITY` frame.

State model:

- Tracks active wave number.
- Tracks spawns by `spawn_id` or `phase/wave/caste/name/task_id`.
- Tracks worker status, task summary, tool count, token count, blockers, files,
  tests, and last message.
- Tracks wave progress from `completed` and `total`.

Rendering rules:

- Plain output prints stable lines, preserving the existing event line first.
- Frame output groups workers into Active, Completed, Blocked, and Other.
- ANSI/control sequences are stripped through the existing sanitizer.
- Long frame text is truncated.
- Go visual metadata through `--visuals` drives caste labels and emoji.

Tests:

- `renders rolling activity frame with active and completed workers`
- `renders blocked workers and truncates long frame text`
- `keeps multi-wave activity history while current wave advances`

Remaining display work:

- Visual polish after seeing real build output in Claude/OpenCode/Codex.
- TTY live redraw/debounce is consciously deferred. The child narrator writes to
  a Go pipe, so true terminal redraw needs an explicit parent-controlled
  terminal contract such as a `--live` flag or Go-side redraw coordinator.

## Working Tree Slice: Phase 4 Specialist Execution Plan

Date: 2026-04-24

This uncommitted build-bridge slice completes the missing Phase 4 specialist
sequencing contract.

Changed files:

- `cmd/codex_build.go`
- `cmd/codex_build_finalize.go`
- `cmd/codex_build_test.go`
- `cmd/codex_visuals.go`
- `cmd/build_wrapper_ceremony_test.go`
- `.aether/commands/build.yaml`
- `.claude/commands/ant/build.md`
- `.opencode/commands/ant/build.md`

Implemented behavior:

- `dispatch_manifest` now includes `execution_plan`.
- Each build dispatch now includes `execution_wave`, while preserving task
  `wave` for builder/scout dependency waves.
- Full builds now sequence specialists explicitly:
  1. Archaeologist (`prep`, full depth)
  2. Oracle (`research`, deep/full)
  3. Architect (`design`, deep/full)
  4. Ambassador (`integration`, conditional on external/API/OAuth/etc. phase
     content)
  5. builder/scout task waves
  6. Probe (`probe`)
  7. Watcher (`verification`)
  8. Measurer (`measurement`, deep/full)
  9. Chaos (`resilience`, full depth)
- Task-scoped redispatch remains narrow: it skips full-phase specialists and
  dispatches only the selected task plus verification/resilience that already
  applied to redispatch.
- `build-finalize` can validate worker results that include `execution_wave`.
- Claude/OpenCode wrappers now execute `dispatch_manifest.execution_plan`
  instead of loosely grouping only by task wave.

Tests added or updated:

- `TestBuildPlanOnlyPrintsDispatchManifestWithoutMutatingState`
- `TestBuildPlanOnlyAddsAmbassadorForIntegrationPhases`
- `TestBuildFinalizeRecordsExternalTaskResultsForContinue`
- `TestBuildSupportsTaskScopedRedispatch`
- `TestBuildWrapperCeremonyContract`

Focused verification run:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestBuildWritesDispatchArtifactsAndUpdatesState|TestBuildPlanOnlyPrintsDispatchManifestWithoutMutatingState|TestBuildPlanOnlyAddsAmbassadorForIntegrationPhases|TestBuildFinalizeRecordsExternalTaskResultsForContinue|TestBuildWrapperCeremonyContract|TestPlatformDocHygiene|TestClaudeOpenCodeCommandParity|TestCommandWrappersDeclareGeneratedSource|TestBuildWaveExecutionPlansRespectParallelMode|TestBuildSupportsTaskScopedRedispatch' -count=1`

## Working Tree Slice: Lifecycle Context Rendering Foundation

Date: 2026-04-24

This uncommitted TypeScript slice continues the lifecycle ceremony work without
changing Go event emission yet.

Changed files:

- `.aether/ts/narrator.ts`
- `.aether/ts/test/narrator.test.ts`
- `.aether/ts/dist/narrator.js`

Implemented behavior:

- The narrator now derives the active lifecycle stage from any
  `ceremony.<stage>.*` topic.
- Wave state is no longer build-specific: any
  `ceremony.<stage>.wave.start` or `ceremony.<stage>.wave.end` event updates the
  rolling frame.
- Worker updates remain payload-driven, so future `ceremony.plan.spawn`,
  `ceremony.continue.spawn`, or similar topics render through the same worker
  sections without TypeScript changes.
- Non-worker lifecycle events are retained as a short `Context` section. This
  keeps `ceremony.skill.activate`, `ceremony.pheromone.emit`, and
  `ceremony.chamber.seal` visible after their compatibility event line scrolls
  by.
- The committed dependency-free runtime was regenerated from TypeScript source.

Tests added:

- `tracks non-build lifecycle wave events generically`
- `keeps lifecycle context notices for skills pheromones and chambers`

Verification run:

- `npm --prefix .aether/ts ci`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts test`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts run build`
- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestEventBusStreamPipesToNarratorRuntime|TestNarratorLauncher|TestBuildSyntheticNarratorDoesNotPolluteJSONOutput|TestRunUpdateSyncCopiesNarratorPackageButSkipsNodeModules' -count=1`

Broad verification completed on 2026-04-24T11:27:54Z:

- `npm --prefix .aether/ts ci`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts test`
- `npm --prefix .aether/ts run build`
- `gofmt -w cmd/codex_build.go cmd/codex_build_finalize.go cmd/codex_visuals.go cmd/codex_build_test.go cmd/build_wrapper_ceremony_test.go`
- `git diff --check`
- `go test ./cmd -count=1`
- `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 300s`
- `go vet ./...`

Next implementation slice:

- Commit and push the verified Phase 4 specialist execution-plan plus
  TypeScript lifecycle-context checkpoint, then continue in order to live
  platform smoke before Phase 5/6 polish.
- Keep JSON mode protected from narrator output.

## Later Phases: Real Agent Spawning Bridge

Build, continue, and plan wrapper bridges are implemented for Claude/OpenCode.
Remaining work is to broaden lifecycle ceremony emission and visible context
across planning, colonize, pheromones, chamber sealing, and graves.

Plan wrapper work:

- Live platform smoke for the manifest-driven Scout and Route-Setter wrapper
  path.
- Expand confidence, assumptions, stall detection, and plan revision ceremony
  where runtime data exists.

Skill work:

- Preserve `skill-match`/`skill-inject` as Go-owned matching.
- Ensure wrapper-spawned agents receive matched skill sections.
- Emit `ceremony.skill.activate` when a worker activates a skill.

## Working Tree Slice: Phase 6 Pheromone And Chamber Events

Date: 2026-04-24

This slice begins Go-backed lifecycle ceremony emission beyond build.

Changed files:

- `cmd/ceremony_emitter.go`
- `cmd/pheromone_write.go`
- `cmd/codex_workflow_cmds.go`
- `cmd/ceremony_emitter_test.go`

Implemented behavior:

- `emitLifecycleCeremony` persists non-build ceremony events to
  `event-bus.jsonl` using the existing `pkg/events` bus.
- `pheromone-write` emits `ceremony.pheromone.emit` with signal type, strength,
  created/reinforced status, and sanitized signal text.
- `aether seal` emits `ceremony.chamber.seal` with Crowned Anthill status and
  completed/total phase counts.
- The generic publisher reuses the existing ceremony payload trimming rules so
  user-controlled event text is bounded before persistence.

Verification run:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'TestLifecycleCeremonyPersistsTrimmedEvent|TestPheromoneWriteEmitsCeremonyEvent|TestSealEmitsChamberCeremonyEvent|TestBuildCeremonyEmitter' -count=1`
- `git diff --check`
- `go test ./cmd -count=1`
- `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 300s`
- `go vet ./...`

## Working Tree Slice: Phase 6 Plan, Colonize, And Continue Wave Events

Date: 2026-04-24

This slice broadens Go-backed lifecycle ceremony emission beyond build,
pheromones, and seal.

Changed files:

- `pkg/events/ceremony.go`
- `cmd/ceremony_emitter.go`
- `cmd/codex_plan.go`
- `cmd/codex_plan_finalize.go`
- `cmd/codex_colonize.go`
- `cmd/codex_continue.go`
- `cmd/codex_continue_finalize.go`
- `cmd/ceremony_emitter_test.go`

Implemented behavior:

- New event topics:
  `ceremony.plan.wave.start`, `ceremony.plan.spawn`,
  `ceremony.plan.wave.end`, `ceremony.colonize.wave.start`,
  `ceremony.colonize.spawn`, `ceremony.colonize.wave.end`,
  `ceremony.continue.wave.start`, `ceremony.continue.spawn`, and
  `ceremony.continue.wave.end`.
- `emitLifecycleCeremonySequence` converts completed Go-owned lifecycle worker
  results into retrospective wave start/spawn/wave end event sequences.
- `plan` and `plan-finalize` now persist Scout/Route-Setter ceremony events.
- `colonize` now persists surveyor ceremony events.
- `continue` and `continue-finalize` now persist verification, review, and
  housekeeping ceremony events from the final worker flow.

Verification run:

- `go test ./cmd -run 'Test.*Ceremony|TestCeremony|TestPlanEmitsLifecycleCeremonyEvents|TestColonizeEmitsLifecycleCeremonyEvents|TestContinueEmitsLifecycleCeremonyEvents' -count=1`
- `go test ./cmd -count=1`
- `git diff --check`
- `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 300s`
- `go vet ./...`

## Release And Rollback

Rollback controls:

- `AETHER_NARRATOR=off` disables the launcher immediately.
- Revert launcher commit to remove sidecar integration while keeping TS runtime.
- Revert wrapper commits independently if Task-tool orchestration regresses.
- Full milestone rollback remains a normal git revert of the v1.6 branch range.

Before release:

- Verify `aether install --package-dir "$PWD"` publishes `.aether/ts` to hub.
- Verify `aether update --force` syncs `.aether/ts` into a fixture repo.
- Verify missing Node falls back cleanly.
- Verify JSON mode is never polluted.
- Verify Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex docs correctly describe their
  authority boundaries.

## Current Next Step

Next, commit and push the Phase 6 plan/colonize/continue wave event slice to
PR #8, then continue with visible worker/skill context events. Platform
Task-tool smoke is still required when Claude or OpenCode is available. The
preconditions now satisfied are:

1. hub fallback smoke passed in a temporary HOME;
2. TTY live redraw is consciously deferred;
3. multi-wave TS fixture passes;
4. build, continue, and plan wrappers now have plan-only/finalizer bridges;
5. focused Go, full Go, TS, vet, and whitespace gates pass;
6. PR #8 is open as a draft and not merged;
7. the branch has merged the PR #5 squash commit from `main` with an
   ancestry-only merge because its tree already matched branch commit
   `c1880184`;
8. PR #6 and PR #7 are merged;
9. Go-side wrapper smoke passed for
   `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json go run ./cmd/aether build 1 --plan-only`, producing
   standard-depth builder wave 11, Probe wave 12, and Watcher wave 13;
10. Phase 6 pheromone/chamber event hooks are implemented and verified;
11. Phase 6 plan/colonize/continue wave event hooks are implemented in the
    working tree with focused, full cmd, full repo, vet, and whitespace checks
    passing.
