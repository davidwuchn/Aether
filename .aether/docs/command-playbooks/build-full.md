description: "🔨🐜🏗️🐜🔨 Build a phase with pure emergence - colony self-organizes and completes tasks"
---

You are the **Queen**. You DIRECTLY spawn multiple workers — do not delegate to a single Prime Worker.

## Pheromone Suggestions

At build start, the colony analyzes the codebase for patterns that might benefit
from pheromone signals (complex files, TODOs, debug artifacts, etc.). Suggested
signals are presented for approval and written as FOCUS pheromones if approved.

Use `--no-suggest` to skip this analysis.

The phase to build is: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Instructions

### Context Confirmation Rule (CRITICAL)

**Before switching to a different colony directory, you MUST confirm with the user.**

When the user mentions a colony name that doesn't match the current directory:
1. State clearly: "You're currently in [Current Directory/Colony Name]"
2. Ask: "Did you mean to switch to [Other Colony], or continue here?"
3. Wait for confirmation — DO NOT proceed until the user clarifies

**Example:**
> User: "THE FUCKING ANIMATION COLONY DO THE NEXT BUILD"
>
> Assistant: "You're currently in SonoTherapie (ACF/WPML site). Did you mean:
> 1. Continue with SonoTherapie (which has animated hero sections)
> 2. Switch to AnalogWave (NEW SITE)
>
> Which would you like?"

This prevents accidental context switches when the user is frustrated or uses imprecise language.

<failure_modes>
### Wave Failure Mid-Build
If a worker fails during a build wave:
- Do NOT continue to next wave (failed dependencies will cascade)
- Report which worker failed, what task it was on, and what was attempted
- Options: (1) Retry the failed task, (2) Skip and continue with remaining tasks, (3) Abort build

### Partial File Writes
If a builder crashes mid-write:
- Check git status for uncommitted partial changes
- If partial changes exist, offer: (1) Review and keep, (2) Revert with git checkout, (3) Stash for later

### State Corruption
If COLONY_STATE.json becomes invalid during build:
- STOP all workers immediately
- Do not attempt to fix state automatically
- Report the issue and offer to restore from last known good state
</failure_modes>

<success_criteria>
Command is complete when:
- All waves executed in order with no skipped dependencies
- Each worker's task output is verified (files exist, tests pass)
- COLONY_STATE.json reflects completed phase progress
- Build summary reports all workers' outcomes
</success_criteria>

<read_only>
Do not touch during build:
- .aether/dreams/ (user notes)
- .aether/chambers/ (archived colonies)
- .env* files
- .claude/settings.json
- .github/workflows/
- Other agents' config files (only modify files assigned to the current build task)
</read_only>

### Step 0.6: Verify LiteLLM Proxy

Check that the LiteLLM proxy is running for model routing:

Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking model proxy...":
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/health | grep -q "healthy" && echo "Proxy healthy" || echo "Proxy not running - workers will use default model"
```

If proxy is not healthy, log a warning but continue (workers will fall back to default routing).

### Step 0.5: Load Colony State

Run using the Bash tool with description "Loading colony state...": `aether load-state`

If the command fails (non-zero exit or JSON has ok: false):
1. Parse error JSON
2. If error code is E_FILE_NOT_FOUND: "No colony initialized. Run /ant-init first." and stop
3. If validation error: Display error details with recovery suggestion and stop
4. For other errors: Display generic error and suggest /ant-status for diagnostics

If successful:
1. Parse the state JSON from result field
2. Check if goal is null - if so: "No colony initialized. Run /ant-init first." and stop
3. Check if `milestone` == `"Crowned Anthill"` - if so: "This colony has been sealed. Start a new colony with `/ant-init \"new goal\"`." and stop
4. Extract current_phase and phase name from plan.phases[current_phase - 1].name
4. Display brief resumption context:
   ```
   🔄 Resuming: Phase X - Name
   ```
   (If HANDOFF.md exists, this provides orientation before the build proceeds)

After displaying context, run using the Bash tool with description "Releasing colony lock...": `aether unload-state` to release the lock.

### Step 1: Validate + Read State

**Parse $ARGUMENTS:**
1. Extract the phase number (first argument)
2. Check remaining arguments for flags:
   - If contains `--verbose` or `-v`: set `verbose_mode = true`
   - If contains `--no-visual`: set `visual_mode = false` (visual is ON by default)
   - If contains `--no-suggest`: set `suggest_enabled = false` (suggestions are ON by default)
   - If contains `--depth <level>`: set `cli_depth_override = <level>`
   - Otherwise: set `visual_mode = true`, `suggest_enabled = true` (defaults)

If the phase number is empty or not a number:

```
Usage: /ant-build <phase_number> [--verbose|-v] [--no-visual] [--no-suggest] [--depth <level>]

Options:
  --verbose, -v       Show full completion details (spawn tree, TDD, patterns)
  --no-visual         Disable real-time visual display (visual is on by default)
  --no-suggest        Skip pheromone suggestion analysis
  --depth <level>     Set colony depth for this build (light|standard|deep|full)

Examples:
  /ant-build 1              Build Phase 1 (with visual display)
  /ant-build 1 --verbose    Build Phase 1 (full details + visual)
  /ant-build 1 --no-visual  Build Phase 1 without visual display
  /ant-build 1 --no-suggest Build Phase 1 without pheromone suggestions
  /ant-build 1 --depth deep Build Phase 1 with thorough investigation
```

Stop here.

**Set colony depth (if --depth flag provided):**
If `cli_depth_override` is set:
1. Run using the Bash tool with description "Setting colony depth...": `aether colony-depth set --depth "$cli_depth_override"`
2. Parse JSON result - if `.ok` is false:
   - Display: `Error: Invalid depth "$cli_depth_override". Use: light, standard, deep, full`
   - Stop here
3. If valid: Display `Colony depth: {level}`

**Read colony depth:**

Run using the Bash tool with description "Reading colony depth...":
```bash
depth_result=$(aether colony-depth get 2>/dev/null || echo '{"ok":true,"result":{"depth":"standard","source":"default"}}')
colony_depth=$(echo "$depth_result" | jq -r '.result.depth // "standard"')
depth_source=$(echo "$depth_result" | jq -r '.result.source // "default"')
echo "colony_depth=$colony_depth"
echo "depth_source=$depth_source"
```

Store `colony_depth` as cross-stage state for use by build-wave.md and build-verify.md.

Display depth with label:
```
Depth: {colony_depth} ({label})
```

Where label maps:
- light -> "Builder only -- fastest"
- standard -> "Builder + Scout -- balanced"
- deep -> "Builder + Scout + Oracle -- thorough"
- full -> "All agents -- most thorough"

If `colony_depth` is "standard" and `depth_source` is "default" (user never explicitly set it), also display:
```
(Tip: use --depth deep for Oracle research, or --depth light for fast builds)
```

**Auto-upgrade old state:**
If `version` field is missing, "1.0", or "2.0":
1. Preserve: `goal`, `state`, `current_phase`, `plan.phases`
2. Write upgraded v3.0 state (same structure as /ant-init but preserving data)
3. Output: `State auto-upgraded to v3.0`
4. Continue with command.

Extract:
- `goal`, `state`, `current_phase` from top level
- `plan.phases` for phase data
- `errors.records` for error context
- `memory` for decisions/learnings

**Validate:**
- If `plan.phases` is empty -> output `No project plan. Run /ant-plan first.` and stop.
- Find the phase matching the requested ID. If not found -> output `Phase {id} not found.` and stop.
- If the phase status is `"completed"` -> output `Phase {id} already completed.` and stop.

### Step 1.5: Blocker Advisory (Non-blocking)

Check for unresolved blocker flags on the requested phase:

Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking for blockers...":
```bash
aether flag-check-blockers {phase_number}
```

Parse the JSON result (`.result.blockers`):

- **If blockers == 0:** Display nothing (or optionally a brief `No active blockers for Phase {id}.` line). Proceed to Step 2.
- **If blockers > 0:** Retrieve blocker details:
  Run using the Bash tool with description "Loading blocker details...":
  ```bash
  aether flag-list --type blocker --phase {phase_number}
  ```
  Parse `.result.flags` and display an advisory warning:
  ```
  ⚠️  BLOCKER ADVISORY: {blockers} unresolved blocker(s) for Phase {id}
  {for each flag in result.flags:}
     - [{flag.id}] {flag.title}
  {end for}

  Consider reviewing with /ant-flags or auto-fixing with /ant-swarm before building.
  Proceeding anyway...
  ```
  **This is advisory only — do NOT stop.** Continue to Step 2 regardless.

### Step 2: Update State

Read then update `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json`:
- Set `state` to `"EXECUTING"`
- Set `current_phase` to the phase number
- Set the phase's `status` to `"in_progress"` in `plan.phases[N]`
- Add `build_started_at` field with current ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
- Append to `events`: `"<timestamp>|phase_started|build|Phase <id>: <name> started"`

If `events` exceeds 100 entries, keep only the last 100.

Write COLONY_STATE.json.

Validate the state file:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Validating colony state...":
```bash
aether validate-state
```

### Step 3: Git Checkpoint

Create a git checkpoint for rollback capability.

Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking git repository...":
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
```

- **If succeeds** (is a git repo):
  1. Check for changes in Aether-managed directories only: `.aether .claude/commands/ant .claude/commands/st .opencode bin`
  2. **If changes exist**: Run using the Bash tool with description "Creating git checkpoint...": `git stash push -m "aether-checkpoint: pre-phase-$PHASE_NUMBER" -- .aether .claude/commands/ant .claude/commands/st .opencode bin ":(exclude).aether/data/"`
     - IMPORTANT: Never use `--include-untracked` — it stashes ALL files including user work!
     - Run using the Bash tool with description "Verifying checkpoint...": `git stash list | head -1 | grep "aether-checkpoint"` — warn if empty
     - Store checkpoint as `{type: "stash", ref: "aether-checkpoint: pre-phase-$PHASE_NUMBER"}`
  3. **If clean working tree**: Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording HEAD position...": `git rev-parse HEAD`
     - Store checkpoint as `{type: "commit", ref: "$HEAD_HASH"}`
- **If fails** (not a git repo): Set checkpoint to `{type: "none", ref: "(not a git repo)"}`.

Rollback procedure: `git stash pop` (if type is "stash") or `git reset --hard $ref` (if type is "commit").

Output header:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔨 B U I L D I N G   P H A S E   {id}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 Phase {id}: {name}
💾 Git checkpoint saved
```

### Step 4: Load Colony Context (colony-prime)

Call `colony-prime --compact` to get unified worker context (wisdom + context capsule + signals + instincts):

Run using the Bash tool with description "Loading colony context...":
```bash
prime_result=$(aether colony-prime --compact 2>/dev/null)
```

**Parse the JSON response:**
- If `.ok` is false: This is a FAIL HARD error - display the error message and stop the build
- If successful: Extract from `.result`:
  - `signal_count` - number of active pheromone signals
  - `instinct_count` - number of filtered instincts
  - `prompt_section` - the formatted markdown to inject into worker prompts
  - `log_line` - status message for display

Display after constraints:
```
{log_line from colony-prime}
```

Then display the active pheromones table by running:
```bash
aether pheromone-display
```

This shows the user exactly what signals are guiding the colony:
- 🎯 FOCUS signals (what to pay attention to)
- 🚫 REDIRECT signals (what to avoid - hard constraints)
- 💬 FEEDBACK signals (guidance to consider)

**Store for worker injection:** The `prompt_section` variable contains compact formatted context (QUEEN wisdom + context capsule + pheromone signals) ready for injection.

### Step 4.0: Load Territory Survey

Check if territory survey exists and load relevant documents:

Run using the Bash tool with description "Loading territory survey...":
```bash
aether survey-load "{phase_name}" 2>/dev/null
```

**Parse the JSON response:**
- If `.ok` is false: Set `survey_docs = null` and skip survey loading
- If successful: Extract `.docs` (comma-separated list) and `.dir`

**Determine phase type from phase name:**
| Phase Contains | Documents to Load |
|----------------|-------------------|
| UI, frontend, component, button, page | DISCIPLINES.md, CHAMBERS.md |
| API, endpoint, backend, route | BLUEPRINT.md, DISCIPLINES.md |
| database, schema, model, migration | BLUEPRINT.md, PROVISIONS.md |
| test, spec, coverage | SENTINEL-PROTOCOLS.md, DISCIPLINES.md |
| integration, external, client | TRAILS.md, PROVISIONS.md |
| refactor, cleanup, debt | PATHOGENS.md, BLUEPRINT.md |
| setup, config, initialize | PROVISIONS.md, CHAMBERS.md |
| *default* | PROVISIONS.md, BLUEPRINT.md |

**Read the relevant survey documents** from `.aether/data/survey/`:
- Extract key patterns to follow
- Note file locations for new code
- Identify known concerns to avoid

**Display summary:**
```
━━━ 🗺️🐜 S U R V E Y   L O A D E D ━━━
{for each doc loaded}
  {emoji} {filename} — {brief description}
{/for}

{if no survey}
  (No territory survey — run /ant-colonize for deeper context)
{/if}
```

**Store for builder injection:**
- `survey_patterns` — patterns to follow
- `survey_locations` — where to place files
- `survey_concerns` — concerns to avoid

### Step 4.1: Archaeologist Pre-Build Scan

**Conditional step — only fires when the phase modifies existing files.**

1. **Detect existing-file modification:**
   Examine each task in the phase. Look at task descriptions, constraints, and hints for signals:
   - Keywords: "update", "modify", "add to", "integrate into", "extend", "change", "refactor", "fix"
   - References to existing file paths (files that already exist in the repo)
   - Task type: if a task is purely "create new file X" with no references to existing code, it is new-file-only

   **If ALL tasks are new-file-only** (no existing files will be modified):
   - Skip this step silently — produce no output, no spawn
   - Proceed directly to Step 4.2

### Step 4.2: Suggest Pheromones (DEPRECATED)

**Conditional step — skipped if `--no-suggest` flag is passed.**

> **DEPRECATED**: The `suggest-*` commands have been deprecated and will be removed
> in a future version. They return `ok:true` with `deprecated:true` for backward
> compatibility. This step now always skips gracefully.

Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking suggest deprecation status...":
```bash
suggest_result=$(aether suggest-approve --dry-run 2>/dev/null)
suggest_deprecated=$(echo "$suggest_result" | jq -r '.result.deprecated // false')

if [[ "$suggest_deprecated" == "true" ]]; then
    # Command is deprecated — skip silently, continue to Step 4.3
    :
elif [[ -z "$suggest_result" ]]; then
    # Command failed entirely — skip silently
    :
else
    # Legacy path: parse suggestion_count (for older aether versions)
    suggestion_count=$(echo "$suggest_result" | jq -r '.result.suggestion_count // 0')
    if [[ "$suggestion_count" -gt 0 ]]; then
        echo "$suggestion_count pheromone suggestion(s) detected from code analysis"
        aether suggest-approve 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
fi
```

**Non-blocking**: This step never stops the build.

**Error handling**:
- If suggest-approve returns error: Skip silently, continue
- If suggest-approve returns deprecated: Skip silently, continue
- Never let suggestion failures block the build

2. **If existing code modification detected — spawn Archaeologist Scout:**

   Generate archaeologist name and dispatch:
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming archaeologist...": `aether generate-ant-name "archaeologist"` (store as `{archaeologist_name}`)
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Dispatching archaeologist...": `aether spawn-log --parent "Queen" --caste "scout" --name "{archaeologist_name}" --task "Pre-build archaeology scan" --depth 0`

   Display:
   ```
   🏺🐜 Archaeologist {archaeologist_name} spawning
       Scanning history of files to be modified...
   ```

   Spawn a Scout (using Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-archaeologist"`, include `description: "🏺 Archaeologist {archaeologist_name}: Pre-build history scan"`) with this prompt:
   # FALLBACK: If "Agent type not found", use general-purpose and inject role: "You are an Archaeologist Ant - git historian that excavates why code exists."

   ```
   You are {Archaeologist-Name}, a 🏺🐜 Archaeologist Ant.

   Mission: Pre-build archaeology scan

   Files: {list of existing files that will be modified}

   Work:
   1. Read each file to understand current state
   2. Run: git log --oneline -15 -- "{file_path}" for history
   3. Run: git log --all --grep="fix\|bug\|workaround\|hack\|revert" --oneline -- "{file_path}" for incident history
   4. Run: git blame "{file_path}" | head -40 for authorship
   5. Note TODO/FIXME/HACK markers

   Log activity: aether activity-log --command "READ" --details "{Ant-Name}: description"

   Report (plain text):
   - WHY key code sections exist (from commits)
   - Known workarounds/hacks to preserve
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Areas of caution (high churn, reverts, emergencies)
   - Stable bedrock vs volatile sand sections
   ```

   **Wait for results** (blocking — use TaskOutput with `block: true`).

   Log completion and update swarm display:
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording archaeologist findings...": `aether spawn-complete --name "{archaeologist_name}" --status "completed" --summary "Pre-build archaeology scan"`

3. **Store and display findings:**

   Store the archaeologist's output as `archaeology_context`.

   Display summary:
   ```
   ━━━ 🏺🐜 A R C H A E O L O G Y ━━━
   {summary of findings from archaeologist}
   ```

4. **Injection into builder prompts:**
   The `archaeology_context` will be injected into builder prompts in Step 5.1 (see below).
   If this step was skipped (no existing files modified), the archaeology section is omitted from builder prompts.

---

### Step 5: Initialize Swarm Display and Analyze Tasks

**YOU (the Queen) will spawn workers directly. Do NOT delegate to a single Prime Worker.**

**Log phase start:**
Run using the Bash tool with description "Logging phase start...":
```bash
aether activity-log --command "EXECUTING" --details "Queen: Phase {id}: {name} - Queen dispatching workers"
```

**Show real-time display header:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Phase {id}: {name} — {N} waves, {M} tasks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Where N = number of builder waves (excluding watcher/chaos) and M = total builder tasks.

Record `build_started_at_epoch=$(date +%s)` — this epoch integer is used by the BUILD SUMMARY block in Step 7 to calculate elapsed time.

Analyze the phase tasks:

Analyze the phase tasks:

1. **Group tasks by dependencies:**
   - **Wave 1:** Tasks with `depends_on: "none"` or `depends_on: []` (can run in parallel)
   - **Wave 2:** Tasks depending on Wave 1 tasks
   - **Wave 3+:** Continue until all tasks assigned

2. **Assign castes:**
   - Implementation tasks → 🔨🐜 Builder
   - Research/docs tasks → 🔍🐜 Scout
   - Testing/validation → 👁️🐜 Watcher (ALWAYS spawn at least one)
   - Resilience testing → 🎲🐜 Chaos (ALWAYS spawn one after Watcher)

3. **Generate ant names for each worker:**

Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming builder ant...": `aether generate-ant-name "builder"`
Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming watcher ant...": `aether generate-ant-name "watcher"`
Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming chaos ant...": `aether generate-ant-name "chaos"`

Display spawn plan with caste emojis:
```
━━━ 🐜 S P A W N   P L A N ━━━

Wave 1  — Parallel
  🔨🐜 {Builder-Name}  Task {id}  {description}
  🔨🐜 {Builder-Name}  Task {id}  {description}

Wave 2  — After Wave 1
  🔨🐜 {Builder-Name}  Task {id}  {description}

Verification
  👁️🐜 {Watcher-Name}  Verify all work independently
  🎲🐜 {Chaos-Name}   Resilience testing (after Watcher)

Total: {N} Builders + 1 Watcher + 1 Chaos = {N+2} spawns
```

**Caste Emoji Legend:**
- 🔨🐜 Builder  (cyan if color enabled)
- 👁️🐜 Watcher  (green if color enabled)
- 🎲🐜 Chaos    (red if color enabled)
- 🔍🐜 Scout    (yellow if color enabled)
- 🏺🐜 Archaeologist (magenta if color enabled)
- 🥚 Queen/Prime

**Every spawn must show its caste emoji.**

**Add to Caste Emoji Legend:**
- 🔌🐜 Ambassador (blue if color enabled) — external integration specialist

### Step 5.0.5: Select and Announce Workflow Pattern

Examine the phase name and task descriptions. Select the first matching pattern:

| Phase contains | Pattern |
|----------------|---------|
| "bug", "fix", "error", "broken", "failing" | Investigate-Fix |
| "research", "oracle", "explore", "investigate" | Deep Research |
| "refactor", "restructure", "clean", "reorganize" | Refactor |
| "security", "audit", "compliance", "accessibility", "license" | Compliance |
| "docs", "documentation", "readme", "guide" | Documentation Sprint |
| (default) | SPBV |

Display the selected pattern:
```
━━ Pattern: {pattern_name} ━━
{announce_line from Queen's Workflow Patterns definition}
```

Store `selected_pattern` for inclusion in the BUILD SUMMARY (Step 7).

### Step 5.1: Spawn Wave 1 Workers (Parallel)

**CRITICAL: Spawn ALL Wave 1 workers in a SINGLE message using multiple Task tool calls.**

**Announce the wave before spawning:**

Display the spawn announcement immediately before firing Task calls:

For single-caste waves (typical — all builders):
```
──── 🔨🐜 Spawning {N} Builders in parallel ────
```

For mixed-caste waves (uncommon):
```
──── 🐜 Spawning {N} workers ({X} 🔨 Builder, {Y} 🔍 Scout) ────
```

For a single worker:
```
──── 🔨🐜 Spawning {ant_name} — {task_summary} ────
```

### Step 5.1.1: Ambassador External Integration (Conditional Caste Replacement)

**Check if any Wave 1 tasks involve external integration:**

For each task in Wave 1, examine the task description and constraints for external integration keywords (case-insensitive):
- "API", "SDK", "OAuth", "external service", "integration", "webhook", "third-party", "stripe", "sendgrid", "twilio", "openai", "aws", "azure", "gcp"

Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking for external integration tasks...":
```bash
# Check phase name and task descriptions for external integration keywords
phase_name="{phase_name_from_state}"
task_descriptions="{concatenated task descriptions from Wave 1}"

integration_keywords="api sdk oauth external integration webhook third-party stripe sendgrid twilio openai aws azure gcp"
is_integration_phase="false"

for keyword in $integration_keywords; do
  if [[ "${phase_name,,}" == *"$keyword"* ]] || [[ "${task_descriptions,,}" == *"$keyword"* ]]; then
    is_integration_phase="true"
    matched_keyword="$keyword"
    break
  fi
done

echo "{\"is_integration_phase\": \"$is_integration_phase\", \"matched_keyword\": \"$matched_keyword\"}"
```

Parse the JSON result. If `is_integration_phase` is `"false"`:
- Skip to standard Builder spawning (continue with existing Step 5.1 logic)

If `is_integration_phase` is `"true"`:

1. **Generate Ambassador name and dispatch:**
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming ambassador...": `aether generate-ant-name "ambassador"` (store as `{ambassador_name}`)
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Dispatching ambassador...": `aether spawn-log --parent "Queen" --caste "ambassador" --name "{ambassador_name}" --task "External integration design" --depth 0`

   Display:
   ```
   ━━━ 🔌🐜 A M B A S S A D O R ━━━
   ──── 🔌🐜 Spawning {ambassador_name} — external integration design ────
   🔌 Ambassador {ambassador_name} spawning — Designing integration for {matched_keyword}...
   ```

2. **Spawn Ambassador using Task tool:**
   Spawn the Ambassador using Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-ambassador"`, include `description: "🔌 Ambassador {Ambassador-Name}: External integration design"` (DO NOT use run_in_background - task blocks until complete):

   # FALLBACK: If "Agent type not found", use general-purpose and inject role: "You are an Ambassador Ant - integration specialist that designs external API connections."

   **Ambassador Worker Prompt (CLEAN OUTPUT):**
   ```
   You are {Ambassador-Name}, a 🔌 Ambassador Ant.

   Mission: Design external integration for Phase {id}

   Phase: {phase_name}
   Trigger keyword: {matched_keyword}

   Task context:
   - Task descriptions: {Wave 1 task descriptions}
   - Files to be created/modified: {from task files}

   Work:
   1. Research the external service/API requirements
   2. Design integration pattern (Client Wrapper, Circuit Breaker, Retry with Backoff)
   3. Plan authentication method (OAuth, API keys, tokens)
   4. Design rate limiting handling
   5. Plan error scenarios (timeout, auth failure, rate limit)
   6. Document required environment variables
   7. Create integration plan for Builder execution

   **Integration Patterns to Consider:**
   - Client Wrapper: Abstract API complexity
   - Circuit Breaker: Handle service failures
   - Retry with Backoff: Handle transient errors
   - Caching: Reduce API calls
   - Queue Integration: Async processing

   **Security Requirements:**
   - API keys must use environment variables
   - No secrets in tracked files
   - HTTPS only
   - Validate SSL certificates

   Log activity: aether activity-log --command "RESEARCH" --details "{Ambassador-Name}: description"

   Return ONLY this JSON (no other text):
   {
     "ant_name": "{Ambassador-Name}",
     "caste": "ambassador",
     "status": "completed" | "failed" | "blocked",
     "summary": "Integration design summary",
     "integration_plan": {
       "service_name": "...",
       "authentication_method": "OAuth|API Key|Token",
       "env_vars_required": ["API_KEY", "..."],
       "integration_pattern": "Client Wrapper|Circuit Breaker|...",
       "rate_limit_handling": "...",
       "error_scenarios_covered": ["timeout", "auth_failure", "rate_limit"],
       "files_to_create": ["..."],
       "implementation_steps": ["..."]
     },
     "endpoints_integrated": [],
     "rate_limits_handled": true,
     "documentation_pages": 0,
     "blockers": []
   }
   ```

3. **Parse Ambassador JSON output:**
   Extract from response: `integration_plan`, `env_vars_required`, `error_scenarios_covered`, `blockers`

   Log completion and update swarm display:
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording ambassador completion...": `aether spawn-complete --name "{ambassador_name}" --status "completed" --summary "Integration design complete"`

   **Display Ambassador completion line:**
   ```
   🔌 {Ambassador-Name}: Integration design ({integration_plan.service_name}) ✓
   ```

4. **Log integration plan to midden:**
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Logging integration plan...":
   ```bash
   aether midden-write --category "integration" --message "Plan for {integration_plan.service_name}: {integration_plan.integration_pattern} pattern, auth via {integration_plan.authentication_method}" --source "ambassador"
   ```

   For each env var required:
   ```bash
   aether midden-write --category "integration" --message "Required env var: {env_var}" --source "ambassador"
   ```

5. **Display integration summary:**
   ```
   🔌 Ambassador complete — Integration plan ready for {integration_plan.service_name}

   Authentication: {integration_plan.authentication_method}
   Pattern: {integration_plan.integration_pattern}
   Env vars: {integration_plan.env_vars_required | join: ", "}

   Builder will execute this plan in Wave 1.
   ```

6. **Store integration plan for Builder injection:**
   Store the `integration_plan` object to be injected into Builder prompts in the standard Wave 1 spawn.

**First, mark build start in context:**
Run using the Bash tool with description "Marking build start...": `aether context-update build-start {phase_id} {wave_1_worker_count} {wave_1_task_count}`

Before dispatching each worker, refresh colony context so new pheromones/memory are visible:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Refreshing colony context...": `prime_result=$(aether colony-prime --compact 2>/dev/null)` and update `prompt_section` from `prime_result.result.prompt_section`.

For each Wave 1 task, use Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-builder"`, include `description: "🔨 Builder {Ant-Name}: {task_description}"` (DO NOT use run_in_background - multiple Task calls in a single message run in parallel and block until complete):

**PER WORKER:** Build graveyard caution context automatically:
- Identify explicit repo file paths from the task metadata (`files`, `hints`, `constraints`, and description when a concrete path is present).
- For each identified file path, run using the Bash tool with description "Checking graveyard cautions for {file}...":
  `aether grave-check --agent "{file}"`
- Parse each JSON result and keep only entries where `caution_level` is `high` or `low`.
- Merge these into a single `grave_context` block for that worker.
- If no file paths are identified, or all checks return `none`, set `grave_context` to empty.
- If `grave_context` is non-empty, display a visible line before spawning that worker:
  `⚰️ Graveyard caution for {ant_name}: {file_1} ({level_1}), {file_2} ({level_2})`

**PER WORKER:** Run using the Bash tool with description "Preparing worker {name}...": `aether spawn-log --parent "Queen" --caste "builder" --name "{ant_name}" --task "{task_description}" --depth 0 && aether context-update worker-spawn "{ant_name}" "builder" "{task_description}"`

**Builder Worker Prompt (CLEAN OUTPUT):**
```
You are {Ant-Name}, a 🔨🐜 Builder Ant.

Task {id}: {description}

Goal: "{colony_goal}"

{ archaeology_context if exists }

{ integration_plan if exists }

{ grave_context if exists }

**External Integration Context (if provided by Ambassador):**
If integration_plan is provided above, you MUST:
1. Follow the implementation_steps in order
2. Use the specified authentication_method
3. Implement the integration_pattern as designed
4. Handle all error_scenarios_covered
5. Reference required env_vars_required (do NOT hardcode values)

{ prompt_section }

**Graveyard Caution Context (if provided):**
- Treat `high` caution files as unstable terrain.
- Preserve proven behavior first, then make minimal safe edits.
- Add tests around any high-caution file before broader refactors.

**IMPORTANT:** When using the Bash tool for activity calls, always include a description parameter:
- activity-log calls → "Logging {action}..."
- pheromone-read calls → "Checking colony signals..."
- spawn-can-spawn calls → "Checking spawn budget..."
- generate-ant-name calls → "Naming sub-worker..."
- spawn-log calls → "Dispatching sub-worker..."

Use colony-flavored language, 4-8 words, trailing ellipsis.

Work:
1. Read .aether/workers.md for Builder discipline
2. Implement task, write tests
3. Log activity using Bash tool with description
4. Update display using Bash tool with description
5. At natural breakpoints (between tasks, after errors): Check for new signals using Bash tool with description

**Approach Change Logging:**
If you try an approach that doesn't work and switch to a different approach, log it:
```bash
colony_name=$(aether colony-name 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.result.name // ""')
[[ -z "$colony_name" ]] && colony_name="unknown"
phase_num=$(jq -r '.phase.number // "unknown"' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

cat >> .aether/midden/approach-changes.md << EOF
- timestamp: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  phase: ${phase_num}
  colony: "${colony_name}"
  worker: "{Ant-Name}"
  task: "{task_id}"
  tried: "initial approach that failed"
  why_it_failed: "reason it didn't work"
  switched_to: "new approach that worked"
EOF

# Write to structured midden for threshold detection (MID-02)
aether midden-write --category "abandoned-approach" --message "Tried: initial approach that failed. Switched to: new approach. Reason: reason it didn't work" --source "builder" 2>/dev/null || true

# Enter memory pipeline for learning observation tracking (MID-02)
aether memory-capture \
  --type "failure" \
  --content "Approach abandoned: initial approach that failed -> new approach (reason it didn't work)" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Spawn sub-workers ONLY if 3x complexity:
- Check spawn budget using Bash tool with description: `aether spawn-can-spawn --depth {depth}`
- Generate name using Bash tool with description
- Announce: "🐜 Spawning {child_name} for {reason}"
- Log spawn using Bash tool with description

Count your total tool calls (Read + Grep + Edit + Bash + Write) and report as tool_count.

Return ONLY this JSON (no other text):
{"ant_name": "{Ant-Name}", "task_id": "{id}", "status": "completed|failed|blocked", "summary": "What you did", "tool_count": 0, "files_created": [], "files_modified": [], "tests_written": [], "blockers": []}
```

### Step 5.2: Process Wave 1 Results

**Task calls return results directly (no TaskOutput needed).**

Before using any worker payload, validate schema:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Validating worker response...": `aether validate-worker-response --response '{worker_json}' --expect-json`
If validation fails, treat the worker as failed with blocker `invalid_worker_response`.

**As each worker result arrives, IMMEDIATELY display a single completion line — do not wait for other workers:**

For successful workers:
```
🔨 {Ant-Name}: {task_description} ({tool_count} tools) ✓
```

For failed workers:
```
🔨 {Ant-Name}: {task_description} ✗ ({failure_reason} after {tool_count} tools)
```

Where `tool_count` comes from the worker's returned JSON `tool_count` field, and `failure_reason` is extracted from the first item in the worker's `blockers` array or "unknown error" if empty.

**Log failure to midden and record observation (MEM-02):**

After displaying a failed worker, run using the Bash tool with description "Logging failure to midden...":
```bash
colony_name=$(aether colony-name 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.result.name // ""')
[[ -z "$colony_name" ]] && colony_name="unknown"
phase_num=$(jq -r '.phase.number // "unknown"' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

# Append to build-failures.md
cat >> .aether/midden/build-failures.md << EOF
- timestamp: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  phase: ${phase_num}
  colony: "${colony_name}"
  worker: "${ant_name}"
  task: "${task_id}"
  what_failed: "${blockers[0]:-$failure_reason}"
  why: "worker returned failed status"
  what_worked: null
  error_type: "worker_failure"
EOF

# Write to structured midden for threshold detection (MID-01)
aether midden-write --category "worker_failure" --message "Builder ${ant_name} failed on task ${task_id}: ${blockers[0]:-$failure_reason}" --source "builder" 2>/dev/null || true

# Capture failure in memory pipeline (observe + pheromone + auto-promotion)
aether memory-capture \
  --type "failure" \
  --content "Builder ${ant_name} failed on task ${task_id}: ${blockers[0]:-$failure_reason}" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**PER WORKER:** Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording {name} completion...": `aether spawn-complete --name "{ant_name}" --status "completed" --summary "{summary}" && aether context-update worker-complete "{ant_name}" "completed"`

**Check for total wave failure:**

After processing all worker results in this wave, check if EVERY worker returned `status: "failed"`. If ALL workers in the wave failed:

Display a prominent halt alert:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ⚠ WAVE FAILURE — BUILD HALTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

All {N} workers in Wave {X} failed. Something is fundamentally wrong.

Failed workers:
  {for each failed worker in this wave:}
  {caste_emoji} {Ant-Name}: {task_description} ✗ ({failure_reason} after {tool_count} tools)
  {end for}

Next steps:
  /ant-flags      Review blockers
  /ant-swarm      Auto-repair mode
```

Then STOP — do not proceed to subsequent waves, Watcher, or Chaos. Skip directly to Step 5.9 synthesis with `status: "failed"`.

**Partial wave failure — escalation path:**

If SOME (but not all) workers in the wave failed:
1. For each failed worker, attempt Tier 3 escalation: Queen spawns a different caste for the same task
2. If Tier 3 succeeds: continue to next wave
3. If Tier 3 fails: display the Tier 4 ESCALATION banner (from Queen agent definition):

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ⚠ ESCALATION — QUEEN NEEDS YOU
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Task: {failed task description}
Phase: {phase number} — {phase name}

Tried:
  • Worker retry (2 attempts) — {what failed}
  • Parent tried alternate approach — {what failed}
  • Queen reassigned to {other caste} — {what failed}

Options:
  A) {recommended option} — RECOMMENDED
  B) {alternate option}
  C) Skip and continue — this task will be marked blocked

Awaiting your choice.
```

Log escalation as flag:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Logging escalation...": `aether flag-add --severity "critical" --type "blocker" --title "{task title}" --description "{failure summary}" --source "escalation" --phase {phase_number}`

If at least one worker succeeded, continue normally to the next wave.

**Parse each worker's validated JSON output to collect:** status, files_created, files_modified, blockers

**Intra-phase midden threshold check (MID-03):**

After processing all wave results, check if any midden error category has reached 3+ occurrences. If so, emit a REDIRECT pheromone mid-build to alert the colony.

Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking midden thresholds...":
```bash
midden_result=$(aether midden-recent-failures 50 2>/dev/null || echo '{"count":0,"failures":[]}')
midden_count=$(echo "$midden_result" | jq '.count // 0')

if [[ "$midden_count" -gt 0 ]]; then
  recurring_categories=$(echo "$midden_result" | jq -r '
    [.failures[] | .category]
    | group_by(.)
    | map(select(length >= 3))
    | map({category: .[0], count: length})
    | .[]
    | @base64
  ' 2>/dev/null || echo "")

  redirect_emit_count=0
  for encoded in $recurring_categories; do
    [[ $redirect_emit_count -ge 3 ]] && break
    [[ -z "$encoded" ]] && continue
    category=$(echo "$encoded" | base64 -d | jq -r '.category')
    count=$(echo "$encoded" | base64 -d | jq -r '.count')

    existing=$(jq -r --arg cat "$category" '
      [.signals[] | select(.active == true and .source == "auto:error" and (.content.text | contains($cat)))] | length
    ' .aether/data/pheromones.json 2>/dev/null || echo "0")

    if [[ "$existing" == "0" ]]; then
      aether pheromone-write --type REDIRECT \
        --content "[error-pattern] Category \"$category\" recurring ($count occurrences)" \
        --strength 0.7 \
        --source "auto:error" \
        --reason "Auto-emitted: midden error pattern recurred 3+ times mid-build" \
        --ttl "30d" 2>/dev/null || true
      redirect_emit_count=$((redirect_emit_count + 1))
    fi
  done

  if [[ $redirect_emit_count -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "Warning: Midden threshold triggered -- $redirect_emit_count REDIRECT pheromone(s) emitted mid-build"
  fi
fi
```

Display if any REDIRECT was emitted:
```
Warning: Midden threshold: "{category}" recurring ({count}x) -- REDIRECT emitted mid-build
```

Chat users see the structured completion lines above.

### Step 5.3: Spawn Wave 2+ Workers (Sequential Waves)

**Before each subsequent wave, display a wave separator:**
```
━━━ 🐜 Wave {X} of {N} ━━━
```
Then display the spawn announcement (same format as Step 5.1).

Repeat Step 5.1-5.2 for each subsequent wave, waiting for previous wave to complete.

### Step 5.4: Spawn Watcher for Verification

**MANDATORY: Always spawn a Watcher — testing must be independent.**

**Announce the verification wave:**
```
━━━ 👁️🐜 V E R I F I C A T I O N ━━━
──── 👁️🐜 Spawning {watcher_name} ────
```

Spawn the Watcher using Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-watcher"`, include `description: "👁️ Watcher {Watcher-Name}: Independent verification"` (DO NOT use run_in_background - task blocks until complete):

Run using the Bash tool with description "Dispatching watcher...": `aether spawn-log --parent "Queen" --caste "watcher" --name "{watcher_name}" --task "Independent verification" --depth 0`

**Watcher Worker Prompt (CLEAN OUTPUT):**
```
You are {Watcher-Name}, a 👁️🐜 Watcher Ant.

Verify all work done by Builders in Phase {id}.

Files to verify:
- Created: {list from builder results}
- Modified: {list from builder results}

{ prompt_section }

**IMPORTANT:** When using the Bash tool for activity calls, always include a description parameter:
- activity-log calls → "Logging {action}..."
- pheromone-read calls → "Checking colony signals..."
- spawn-log calls → "Dispatching sub-worker..."

Use colony-flavored language, 4-8 words, trailing ellipsis.

Verification:
1. Check files exist (Read each)
2. Run build/type-check
3. Run tests if they exist
4. Check success criteria: {list}

Spawn sub-workers if needed:
- Log spawn using Bash tool with description
- Announce: "🐜 Spawning {child} to investigate {issue}"

Count your total tool calls (Read + Grep + Edit + Bash + Write) and report as tool_count.

Return ONLY this JSON:
{"ant_name": "{Watcher-Name}", "verification_passed": true|false, "files_verified": [], "issues_found": [], "quality_score": N, "tool_count": 0, "recommendation": "proceed|fix_required"}
```

### Step 5.5: Process Watcher Results

**Task call returns results directly (no TaskOutput needed).**

Validate watcher payload first:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Validating watcher response...": `aether validate-worker-response --response '{watcher_json}' --expect-json`

**Parse the Watcher's validated JSON response:** verification_passed, issues_found, quality_score, recommendation

**Display Watcher completion line:**

For successful verification:
```
👁️ {Watcher-Name}: Independent verification ({tool_count} tools) ✓
```

For failed verification:
```
👁️ {Watcher-Name}: Independent verification ✗ ({issues_found count} issues after {tool_count} tools)
```

**Store results for synthesis in Step 5.7**

### Step 5.5.1: Measurer Performance Agent (Conditional)

**Conditional step — only runs for performance-sensitive phases.**

1. **Check if phase is performance-sensitive:**

   Extract phase name from COLONY_STATE.json (already loaded in Step 1). Check for performance keywords (case-insensitive):
   - "performance", "optimize", "latency", "throughput", "benchmark", "speed", "memory", "cpu", "efficiency"

   Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking phase for performance sensitivity...":
   ```bash
   phase_name="{phase_name_from_state}"
   performance_keywords="performance optimize latency throughput benchmark speed memory cpu efficiency"
   is_performance_sensitive="false"
   for keyword in $performance_keywords; do
     if [[ "${phase_name,,}" == *"$keyword"* ]]; then
       is_performance_sensitive="true"
       break
     fi
   done
   echo "{\"is_performance_sensitive\": \"$is_performance_sensitive\", \"phase_name\": \"$phase_name\"}"
   ```

   Parse the JSON result. If `is_performance_sensitive` is `"false"`:
   - Display: `📊 Measurer: Phase not performance-sensitive — skipping baseline measurement`
   - Skip to Step 5.6 (Chaos Ant)

2. **Check Watcher verification status:**

   Only spawn Measurer if Watcher verification passed (`verification_passed: true`). If Watcher failed:
   - Display: `📊 Measurer: Watcher verification failed — skipping performance measurement`
   - Skip to Step 5.6 (Chaos Ant)

3. **Generate Measurer name and dispatch:**

   Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming measurer...": `aether generate-ant-name "measurer"` (store as `{measurer_name}`)
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Dispatching measurer...": `aether spawn-log --parent "Queen" --caste "measurer" --name "{measurer_name}" --task "Performance baseline measurement" --depth 0`

   Display:
   ```
   ━━━ 📊🐜 M E A S U R E R ━━━
   ──── 📊🐜 Spawning {measurer_name} — establishing performance baselines ────
   📊 Measurer {measurer_name} spawning — Establishing performance baselines for {phase_name}...
   ```

4. **Get files to measure:**

   Use `files_created` and `files_modified` from builder results (already collected in synthesis preparation). Filter for source files only:
   - Include: `.js`, `.ts`, `.go`, `.py` files
   - Exclude: `.test.js`, `.test.ts`, `.spec.js`, `.spec.ts`, `__tests__/`, config files

   Store filtered list as `{source_files_to_measure}`.

5. **Spawn Measurer using Task tool:**

   Spawn the Measurer using Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-measurer"`, include `description: "📊 Measurer {Measurer-Name}: Performance baseline measurement"` (DO NOT use run_in_background - task blocks until complete):

   # FALLBACK: If "Agent type not found", use general-purpose and inject role: "You are a Measurer Ant - performance profiler that benchmarks and identifies bottlenecks."

   **Measurer Worker Prompt (CLEAN OUTPUT):**
   ```
   You are {Measurer-Name}, a 📊 Measurer Ant.

   Mission: Performance baseline measurement for Phase {id}

   Phase: {phase_name}
   Keywords that triggered spawn: {matched_keywords}

   Files to measure:
   - {list from source_files_to_measure}

   Work:
   1. Read each source file to understand operation patterns
   2. Analyze algorithmic complexity (Big O) for key functions
   3. Identify potential bottlenecks (loops, recursion, I/O)
   4. Document current baseline metrics for comparison
   5. Recommend optimizations with estimated impact

   **IMPORTANT:** You are strictly read-only. Do not modify any files.

   Log activity: aether activity-log --command "BENCHMARKING" --details "{Measurer-Name}: description"

   Return ONLY this JSON (no other text):
   {
     "ant_name": "{Measurer-Name}",
     "caste": "measurer",
     "status": "completed" | "failed" | "blocked",
     "summary": "What you measured and found",
     "metrics": {
       "response_time_ms": 0,
       "throughput_rps": 0,
       "cpu_percent": 0,
       "memory_mb": 0
     },
     "baselines_established": [
       {"operation": "name", "complexity": "O(n)", "file": "path", "line": 0}
     ],
     "bottlenecks_identified": [
       {"description": "...", "severity": "high|medium|low", "location": "file:line"}
     ],
     "recommendations": [
       {"priority": 1, "change": "...", "estimated_improvement": "..."}
     ],
     "tool_count": 0
   }
   ```

6. **Parse Measurer JSON output:**

   Extract from response: `baselines_established`, `bottlenecks_identified`, `recommendations`, `tool_count`

   Log completion and update swarm display:
   Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording measurer completion...": `aether spawn-complete --name "{measurer_name}" --status "completed" --summary "Baselines established, bottlenecks identified"`

   **Display Measurer completion line:**
   ```
   📊 {Measurer-Name}: Performance baseline measurement ({tool_count} tools) ✓
   ```

7. **Log findings to midden:**

   For each baseline established, run using the Bash tool with description "Logging baseline...":
   ```bash
   aether midden-write --category "performance" --message "Baseline: {baseline.operation} ({baseline.complexity}) at {baseline.file}:{baseline.line}" --source "measurer"
   ```

   For each bottleneck identified, run using the Bash tool with description "Logging bottleneck...":
   ```bash
   aether midden-write --category "performance" --message "Bottleneck: {bottleneck.description} ({bottleneck.severity}) at {bottleneck.location}" --source "measurer"
   ```

   For each recommendation, run using the Bash tool with description "Logging recommendation...":
   ```bash
   aether midden-write --category "performance" --message "Recommendation (P{rec.priority}): {rec.change} - {rec.estimated_improvement}" --source "measurer"
   ```

8. **Display summary and store for synthesis:**

   Display:
   ```
   📊 Measurer complete — {baseline_count} baselines, {bottleneck_count} bottlenecks logged to midden
   ```

   Store Measurer results in synthesis data structure:
   - Add `performance` object to synthesis JSON with: `baselines_established`, `bottlenecks_identified`, `recommendations`
   - Include in BUILD SUMMARY display: `📊 Measurer: {baseline_count} baselines established, {bottleneck_count} bottlenecks identified`

9. **Continue to Chaos Ant:**

   Proceed to Step 5.6 (Chaos Ant) regardless of Measurer results — Measurer is strictly non-blocking.

### Step 5.6: Spawn Chaos Ant for Resilience Testing

**After the Watcher completes, spawn a Chaos Ant to probe the phase work for edge cases and boundary conditions.**

Generate a chaos ant name and dispatch:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming chaos ant...": `aether generate-ant-name "chaos"` (store as `{chaos_name}`)
Run using the Bash tool with description "Loading existing flags...": `aether flag-list --phase {phase_number}`
Parse the result and extract unresolved flag titles into a list: `{existing_flag_titles}` (comma-separated titles from `.result.flags[].title`). If no flags exist, set `{existing_flag_titles}` to "None".
Run using the Bash tool with description "Dispatching chaos ant...": `aether spawn-log --parent "Queen" --caste "chaos" --name "{chaos_name}" --task "Resilience testing of Phase {id} work" --depth 0`

**Announce the resilience testing wave:**
```
──── 🎲🐜 Spawning {chaos_name} — resilience testing ────
```

Spawn the Chaos Ant using Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-chaos"`, include `description: "🎲 Chaos {Chaos-Name}: Resilience testing"` (DO NOT use run_in_background - task blocks until complete):
# FALLBACK: If "Agent type not found", use general-purpose and inject role: "You are a Chaos Ant - resilience tester that probes edge cases and boundary conditions."

**Chaos Ant Prompt (CLEAN OUTPUT):**
```
You are {Chaos-Name}, a 🎲🐜 Chaos Ant.

Test Phase {id} work for edge cases and boundary conditions.

Files to test:
- {list from builder results}

Skip these known issues: {existing_flag_titles}

**IMPORTANT:** When using the Bash tool for activity calls, always include a description parameter:
- activity-log calls → "Logging {action}..."
- pheromone-read calls → "Checking colony signals..."

Use colony-flavored language, 4-8 words, trailing ellipsis.

Rules:
- Max 5 scenarios
- Read-only (don't modify code)
- Focus: edge cases, boundaries, error handling

Count your total tool calls (Read + Grep + Edit + Bash + Write) and report as tool_count.

Return ONLY this JSON:
{"ant_name": "{Chaos-Name}", "scenarios_tested": 5, "findings": [{"id": 1, "category": "edge_case|boundary|error_handling", "severity": "critical|high|medium|low", "title": "...", "description": "..."}], "overall_resilience": "strong|moderate|weak", "tool_count": 0, "summary": "..."}
```

### Step 5.7: Process Chaos Ant Results

**Task call returns results directly (no TaskOutput needed).**

**Parse the Chaos Ant's JSON response:** findings, overall_resilience, summary

**Display Chaos completion line:**
```
🎲 {Chaos-Name}: Resilience testing ({tool_count} tools) ✓
```

**Store results for synthesis in Step 5.9**

**Flag critical/high findings:**

If any findings have severity `"critical"` or `"high"`:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Flagging {finding.title}...": `aether flag-add --severity "critical" --type "blocker" --title "{finding.title}" --description "{finding.description}" --source "chaos-testing" --phase {phase_number} && aether activity-log --command "FLAG" --details "Chaos: Created blocker: {finding.title}"`

**Log resilience finding to midden (MEM-02):**

For each critical/high finding, run using the Bash tool with description "Logging resilience finding...":
```bash
colony_name=$(aether colony-name 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.result.name // ""')
[[ -z "$colony_name" ]] && colony_name="unknown"
phase_num=$(jq -r '.phase.number // "unknown"' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

# Append to build-failures.md
cat >> .aether/midden/build-failures.md << EOF
- timestamp: "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
  phase: ${phase_num}
  colony: "${colony_name}"
  worker: "${chaos_name}"
  test_context: "resilience"
  what_failed: "${finding.title}"
  why: "${finding.description}"
  what_worked: null
  severity: "${finding.severity}"
EOF

# Write to structured midden for threshold detection (MID-01)
aether midden-write --category "resilience" --message "Chaos finding: ${finding.title} (${finding.severity})" --source "chaos" 2>/dev/null || true

# Capture resilience failure in memory pipeline (observe + pheromone + auto-promotion)
aether memory-capture \
  --type "failure" \
  --content "Resilience issue found: ${finding.title} (${finding.severity})" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Log chaos ant completion and update swarm display:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording chaos completion...": `aether spawn-complete --name "{chaos_name}" --status "completed" --summary "{summary}"`

### Step 5.8: Create Flags for Verification Failures

If the Watcher reported `verification_passed: false` or `recommendation: "fix_required"`:

For each issue in `issues_found`:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Flagging {issue_title}...": `aether flag-add --severity "critical" --type "blocker" --title "{issue_title}" --description "{issue_description}" --source "verification" --phase {phase_number} && aether activity-log --command "FLAG" --details "Watcher: Created blocker: {issue_title}"`

**Log verification failure to midden (MEM-02):**

After flagging each issue, run using the Bash tool with description "Logging verification failure...":
```bash
colony_name=$(aether colony-name 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.result.name // ""')
[[ -z "$colony_name" ]] && colony_name="unknown"
phase_num=$(jq -r '.phase.number // "unknown"' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

# Append to test-failures.md
cat >> .aether/midden/test-failures.md << EOF

```

This ensures verification failures are persisted as blockers that survive context resets. Chaos Ant findings are flagged in Step 5.7.

### Step 5.9: Synthesize Results

**This step runs after all worker tasks have completed (Builders, Watcher, Chaos).**

Collect all worker outputs and create phase summary:

```json
{
  "status": "completed" | "failed" | "blocked",
  "summary": "...",
  "tasks_completed": [...],
  "tasks_failed": [...],
  "files_created": [...],
  "files_modified": [...],
  "spawn_metrics": {
    "spawn_count": {total workers spawned, including archaeologist if Step 4.5 fired, measurer if Step 5.5.1 fired, ambassador if Step 5.1.1 fired},
    "builder_count": {N},
    "watcher_count": 1,
    "chaos_count": 1,
    "archaeologist_count": {0 or 1, conditional on Step 4.5},
    "measurer_count": {0 or 1, conditional on Step 5.5.1},
    "ambassador_count": {0 or 1, conditional on Step 5.1.1},
    "parallel_batches": {number of waves}
  },
  "spawn_tree": {
    "{Archaeologist-Name}": {"caste": "archaeologist", "task": "pre-build history scan", "status": "completed"},
    "{Ambassador-Name}": {"caste": "ambassador", "task": "external integration design", "status": "completed"},
    "{Builder-Name}": {"caste": "builder", "task": "...", "status": "completed"},
    "{Watcher-Name}": {"caste": "watcher", "task": "verify", "status": "completed"},
    "{Measurer-Name}": {"caste": "measurer", "task": "performance baseline", "status": "completed"},
    "{Chaos-Name}": {"caste": "chaos", "task": "resilience testing", "status": "completed"}
  },
  "verification": {from Watcher output},
  "performance": {from Measurer output, or null if Step 5.5.1 was skipped},
  "resilience": {from Chaos Ant output},
  "archaeology": {from Archaeologist output, or null if Step 4.5 was skipped},
  "quality_notes": "..."
}
```

**Graveyard Recording:**
For each worker that returned `status: "failed"`:
  For each file in that worker's `files_modified` or `files_created`:
Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording failure grave...": `aether grave-add --agent "{ant_name}" --reason "{first blocker or summary}" --phase {phase} && aether activity-log --command "GRAVE" --details "Queen: Grave marker placed at {file} — {ant_name} failed: {summary}"`
  Then display a user-visible confirmation line:
  `⚰️ Grave recorded: {file} — {ant_name} failed ({summary})`

**Error Handoff Update:**
If workers failed, update handoff with error context for recovery:

Resolve the build error handoff template path:
  Check ~/.aether/system/templates/handoff-build-error.template.md first,
  then .aether/templates/handoff-build-error.template.md.

If no template found: output "Template missing: handoff-build-error.template.md. Run aether update to fix." and stop.

Read the template file. Fill all {{PLACEHOLDER}} values:
  - {{PHASE_NUMBER}} → current phase number
  - {{PHASE_NAME}} → current phase name
  - {{BUILD_TIMESTAMP}} → current ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
  - {{FAILED_WORKERS}} → formatted list of failed workers (one "- {ant_name}: {failure_summary}" per line)
  - {{GRAVE_MARKERS}} → formatted list of grave markers (one "- {file}: {caution_level} caution" per line)

Remove the HTML comment lines at the top of the template.
Write the result to .aether/HANDOFF.md using the Write tool.

Only fires when workers fail. Zero impact on successful builds.

--- SPAWN TRACKING ---

The spawn tree will be visible in `/ant-watch` because each spawn is logged.

    ]
  },
  "quality_notes": "Any concerns or recommendations",
  "ui_touched": true | false
}
```

### Step 6: Visual Checkpoint (if UI touched)

Parse synthesis result. If `ui_touched` is true:

```
━━━ 🖼️🐜 V I S U A L   C H E C K P O I N T ━━━

UI changes detected. Verify appearance before continuing.

Files touched:
{list files from files_created + files_modified that match UI patterns}

Options:
  1. Approve - UI looks correct
  2. Reject - needs changes (describe issues)
  3. Skip - defer visual review
```

Use AskUserQuestion to get approval. Record in events:
- If approved: `"<timestamp>|visual_approved|build|Phase {id} UI approved"`
- If rejected: `"<timestamp>|visual_rejected|build|Phase {id} UI rejected: {reason}"`

### Step 6.5: Update Handoff Document

After synthesis is complete, update the handoff document with current state for session recovery:

```bash
# Update handoff with build results
jq -n \
  --arg timestamp "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  --arg goal "$(jq -r '.goal' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json)" \
  --arg phase "$(jq -r '.current_phase' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json)" \
  --arg phase_name "{phase_name}" \
  --arg status "{synthesis.status}" \
  --arg summary "{synthesis.summary}" \
  --argjson tasks_completed '{synthesis.tasks_completed | length}' \
  --argjson tasks_failed '{synthesis.tasks_failed | length}' \
  --arg next_action "{if synthesis.status == "completed" then "/ant-continue" else "/ant-flags" end}" \
  '{
    "last_updated": $timestamp,
    "goal": $goal,
    "current_phase": $phase,
    "phase_name": $phase_name,
    "build_status": $status,
    "summary": $summary,
    "tasks_completed": $tasks_completed,
    "tasks_failed": $tasks_failed,
    "next_recommended_action": $next_action,
    "can_resume": true,
    "note": "Phase build completed. Run /ant-continue to advance if verification passed."
  }' > .aether/data/last-build-result.json
```

Resolve the build success handoff template path:
  Check ~/.aether/system/templates/handoff-build-success.template.md first,
  then .aether/templates/handoff-build-success.template.md.

If no template found: output "Template missing: handoff-build-success.template.md. Run aether update to fix." and stop.

Read the template file. Fill all {{PLACEHOLDER}} values:
  - {{GOAL}} → colony goal (from COLONY_STATE.json)
  - {{PHASE_NUMBER}} → current phase number
  - {{PHASE_NAME}} → current phase name
  - {{BUILD_STATUS}} → synthesis.status
  - {{BUILD_TIMESTAMP}} → current ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
  - {{BUILD_SUMMARY}} → synthesis summary
  - {{TASKS_COMPLETED}} → count of completed tasks
  - {{TASKS_FAILED}} → count of failed tasks
  - {{FILES_CREATED}} → count of created files
  - {{FILES_MODIFIED}} → count of modified files
  - {{SESSION_NOTE}} → "Build succeeded — ready to advance." if status is completed, else "Build completed with issues — review before continuing."

Remove the HTML comment lines at the top of the template.
Write the result to .aether/HANDOFF.md using the Write tool.

This ensures the handoff always reflects the latest build state, even if the session crashes before explicit pause.

### Step 6.5: Update Context Document

Log this build activity to `.aether/CONTEXT.md`:

Run using the Bash tool with description "Updating build context...": `aether context-update activity "build {phase_id}" "{synthesis.status}" "{files_created_count + files_modified_count}" && aether context-update build-complete "{synthesis.status}" "{synthesis.status == 'completed' ? 'success' : 'failed'}"`

Also update safe-to-clear status:
- If build completed successfully: `context-update safe-to-clear "YES" "Build complete, ready to continue"`
- If build failed: `context-update safe-to-clear "NO" "Build failed — run /ant-swarm or /ant-flags"`

### Step 5.10: Check for Promotion Proposals

After build completion (success or failure), check if any observations have met promotion thresholds.

Run using the Bash tool with description "Checking for wisdom promotions...":
```bash
proposals=$(aether learning-check-promotion 2>/dev/null || echo '{"proposals":[]}')
proposal_count=$(echo "$proposals" | jq '.proposals | length')
echo "{\"proposal_count\": $proposal_count}"
```

Parse the result. If proposal_count > 0:
- Display: "📚 $proposal_count wisdom proposal(s) ready for review"
- Run: `aether learning-approve-proposals`
- This presents the one-at-a-time UI for user review

If proposal_count == 0:
- Silently continue (no output needed per user decision)

Note: This runs regardless of build success/failure. Failed builds may have recorded failure observations that are ready for promotion.

### Step 7: Display Results

**This step runs ONLY after synthesis is complete. All values come from actual worker results.**

**Display BUILD SUMMARY (always shown, replaces compact/verbose split):**

Calculate `total_tools` by summing `tool_count` from all worker return JSONs (builders + watcher + chaos).
Calculate `elapsed` using `build_started_at_epoch` (epoch integer captured at Step 5 start by Plan 01): `$(( $(date +%s) - build_started_at_epoch ))` formatted as Xm Ys.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔨 B U I L D   S U M M A R Y
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📍 Phase {id}: {name}
🎲 Pattern:  {selected_pattern}

🐜 Workers:  {pass_count} passed  {fail_count} failed  ({total} total)
🛠️ Tools:    {total_tools} calls across all workers
⏱️ Duration: {elapsed}

{if measurer_ran:}
📊 Measurer: {baseline_count} baselines established, {bottleneck_count} bottlenecks identified
{end if}

{if ambassador_ran:}
🔌 Ambassador: Integration plan for {integration_plan.service_name} ready
{end if}

{if fail_count > 0:}
Failed:
  {for each failed worker:}
  {caste_emoji} {Ant-Name}: {task_description} ✗ ({failure_reason} after {tool_count} tools)
  {end for}

Retry: /ant-swarm to auto-repair failed tasks, or /ant-flags to review blockers
{end if}
```

**If verbose_mode is true**, additionally show the spawn tree and TDD details after the BUILD SUMMARY block (keep the existing verbose-only sections: Colony Work Tree, Tasks Completed, TDD, Patterns Learned, Debugging, Model Routing). Prepend with:
```
━━ Details (--verbose) ━━
```

After displaying the BUILD SUMMARY (and optional verbose details), call the Next Up helper by running using the Bash tool with description "Displaying next steps...":
```bash
state=$(jq -r '.state // "IDLE"' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "IDLE")
current_phase=$(jq -r '.current_phase // 0' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
total_phases=$(jq -r '.plan.phases | length' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
aether print-next-up "$state" "$current_phase" "$total_phases"
```

**Routing Note:** The state-based Next Up block above routes based on colony state. If verification failed or blockers exist, review `/ant-flags` before continuing.

**IMPORTANT:** Build does NOT update task statuses or advance state. Run `/ant-continue` to:
- Mark tasks as completed
- Extract learnings
- Advance to next phase

### Step 8: Update Session

Update the session tracking file to enable `/ant-resume` after context clear:

Run using the Bash tool with description "Saving build session...": `aether session-update --command "/ant-build {phase_id}" --suggested-next "/ant-continue" --summary "Phase {phase_id} build completed: {synthesis.status}"`
