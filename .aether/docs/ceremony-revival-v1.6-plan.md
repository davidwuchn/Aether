# Ceremony Revival via Bundled TypeScript Narrator

Milestone: v1.6

## Architecture

Go owns state, dispatch contracts, event truth, and lifecycle safety. The bundled
TypeScript narrator owns rich terminal rendering. The LLM wrapper owns real
Task-tool subagent spawning on platforms that expose that tool.

This deliberately keeps the Go rewrite. The goal is to restore v5.4's ceremony
and real worker bridge on top of the current runtime instead of replacing it.

## Verified Assumptions

- Node is already part of the public npm bootstrap path: `npm/package.json`
  requires Node `>=18`. For direct Go-only installs, Node remains optional.
- `.aether/ts` is embedded as an explicit file list in `embedded_assets.go` so
  install/update syncs the narrator package without accidentally shipping
  `node_modules`.
- `pkg/events.Bus.Subscribe` is in-process only. Cross-process narration needs
  either parent-process piping or a file-backed stream over `event-bus.jsonl`.
- Current playbooks still contain the intended direct-spawn flow. In particular,
  `build-wave.md` and `build-full.md` explicitly instruct the Queen to spawn
  caste agents with the Task tool, log spawn state, run Probe verification, and
  persist failures to midden/graves.
- Current Go build/plan/colonize paths render dispatches and artifacts, but the
  markdown wrappers do not yet parse manifests and spawn Claude/OpenCode agents.

## Phase 1: Assumptions and Gap Audit

- Map current wrapper behavior against the v5.4 direct-spawn playbooks.
- Define the platform contract: Go command state vs wrapper Task-tool authority.
- Record the event protocol the narrator consumes.
- Preserve Codex best-effort direct CLI execution without claiming Claude/OpenCode
  Task-tool work happened inside Go.

## Phase 2: Event Protocol and Narrator Foundations

- Add `.aether/ts` with a strict TypeScript narrator package. (Initial scaffold
  exists.)
- Embed `.aether/ts` in install assets with explicit files only. (Initial
  scaffold exists.)
- Add ceremony event topic and payload types. (Initial scaffold exists.)
- Add `event-bus-subscribe --stream --filter ceremony.*` for NDJSON streaming.
  (Initial scaffold exists.)
- Add `visuals-dump --json` so TS consumes Go's caste emoji/color/label maps.
  (Initial scaffold exists.)
- Build a narrator stub that reads NDJSON from stdin and prints one ceremony line
  per event. (Initial scaffold exists; runtime launch is not wired yet.)

## Phase 3: Rolling Activity Display

- Maintain an in-memory ceremony frame keyed by spawn ID.
- Render wave progress, active workers, completed workers, tool counts, blockers,
  and token counts where available.
- Strip ANSI when stdout is not a TTY unless explicitly forced.
- Debounce live redraws if event volume makes the terminal flicker.

## Phase 4: Subagent Spawn Restoration

- Restore Claude/OpenCode build wrappers as orchestrators, not pass-throughs.
- Run `aether build --plan-only <phase>` or equivalent manifest generation.
- For each wave, spawn real caste agents via the platform agent tool.
- Restore pre-wave Archaeologist, Oracle, Architect, and Ambassador hooks.
- Restore Builder waves, Probe verification, Watcher verification, Measurer, and
  Chaos.
- Call `aether spawn-log` before each Task call and `aether spawn-complete` after
  each returned result so the narrator and spawn tree reflect real work.

## Phase 5: Continue and Plan Orchestration

- Restore continue as real verification before advancement.
- Restore plan depth ceremony: Fast, Balanced, Deep, Exhaustive.
- Run Scout plus Route-Setter planning loops with stall detection and confidence.
- Persist validated learnings, midden failures, and blocker status honestly.

## Phase 6: Full Lifecycle Ceremony and Skills

- Add narrator ceremonies for colonize, plan, build, continue, pheromones,
  graveyard/entomb, and chamber sealing.
- Emit skill activation events from worker prompts or spawn wrappers.
- Keep QUEEN.md, Hive, midden, graveyard, and pheromone context visible where
  they affect worker behavior.

## Phase 7: Parity, Verification, and Release

- Verify Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex surfaces do not drift.
- Verify `AETHER_NARRATOR=off` and missing Node both fall back cleanly.
- Verify `aether update --force` syncs `.aether/ts`.
- Keep rollback simple: disable narrator by env var, revert wrapper playbook
  commits independently, or revert the full v1.6 milestone.

## Out of Scope

- Reverting the Go runtime rewrite.
- Reviving the old standalone `aether-colony` runtime package.
- Redesigning the visual language beyond v5.4 parity.
- Reworking Hive Brain internals beyond restoring visible lifecycle integration.
