# Aether Source-of-Truth Map

Updated: 2026-04-15 (v2.2 -- removed stale Node.js reference, added Codex CLI platform entries)

## Purpose

Define which files are authoritative for system behavior, which files are derived, and where documentation is currently out of sync.

## Authority Precedence (Highest to Lowest)

1. **Executable runtime**
- `.aether/aether CLI` and sourced scripts in `.aether/utils/`
- Go binary in `cmd/` (primary) and `pkg/` (shared packages)
- Why: these files are what actually execute.

2. **Command execution specifications**
- `.claude/commands/ant/*.md`
- Why: these drive slash-command behavior in Claude Code.

2.5. **Agent behavior specifications**
- `.claude/agents/ant/*.md` and `.opencode/agents/*.md`
- `.codex/agents/*.toml` (Codex CLI agent definitions)
- Why: these define worker behavior when commands spawn subagents.

3. **State/data artifacts (runtime outputs, not policy)**
- `.aether/data/*` (state, pheromones, observations, flags)
- Why: these represent current colony state, not command intent.

4. **Human-facing documentation**
- Root `README.md`
- `.aether/docs/*.md`
- Why: explanatory, not executable.

## Ownership Map

| Domain | Authoritative Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Core deterministic operations | `.aether/aether CLI` | Dispatcher that loads domain modules on demand (~5,200 lines) |
| Slash command orchestration | `.claude/commands/ant/*.md` | Includes build/continue orchestrators |
| Worker behavior specs | `.claude/agents/ant/*.md` | 24 Claude agent definitions (Builder, Watcher, etc.) |
| Packaged Claude agent mirror | `.aether/agents-claude/*.md` | Distribution mirror; must stay byte-identical with `.claude/agents/ant/*.md` |
| OpenCode command surface | `.opencode/commands/ant/*.md` | 45 OpenCode command files; structure parity with Claude commands |
| OpenCode worker behavior specs | `.opencode/agents/*.md` | 24 OpenCode agent definitions |
| Codex CLI instructions | `.codex/CODEX.md` | Codex configuration and prompt instructions |
| Codex worker behavior specs | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | 24 Codex agent definitions (TOML format) |
| Packaged Codex agent mirror | `.aether/agents-codex/*.toml` | Distribution mirror; must stay byte-identical with `.codex/agents/*.toml` |
| Codex skill definitions | `.aether/skills-codex/*/SKILL.md` | 28 Codex skills (10 colony + 18 domain) |
| Domain modules | `cmd/` (Go binary) | Extracted from aether CLI in Phase 13; sourced on demand |
| Build/continue split stages | `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/*.md` | Loaded by orchestrators; executable instruction docs |
| Output templates | `.aether/templates/*` | Templates for generated state/handoff/wisdom/session artifacts |
| Colony wisdom source | `.aether/QUEEN.md` + `~/.aether/QUEEN.md` | Read by `queen-read`/`colony-prime` |
| User preferences | `~/.aether/QUEEN.md` (User Preferences section) | Managed by `/ant:preferences`; read by `queen-read`/`colony-prime` |
| Hive wisdom (cross-repo) | `~/.aether/eternal/memory.json` | High-value signals shared across colonies; read by `colony-prime` |
| Pheromone runtime state | `.aether/data/pheromones.json` | Active signals with TTL/decay semantics |
| Autopilot run state | `.aether/data/run-state.json` | Tracks autopilot phase, pause reasons, iteration count |
| Session/state | `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json`, `.aether/data/*.json` | Mutable runtime state |
| Colony registry | `~/.aether/registry.json` | All registered repos with metadata and domain tags |
| Package/distribution scope | `package.json` (`files`) + `.npmignore` | Defines what ships vs excluded |
| Repo-level onboarding docs | `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | Should reflect runtime/commands, never override them |

## Confirmed Implementation Facts

- Utility dispatcher and subcommands are implemented in `.aether/aether CLI` (`case "$cmd" in`).
- Context continuity primitives are runtime-backed in `.aether/aether CLI`:
  - `context-capsule` (compact prompt context),
  - `rolling-summary` (bounded narrative log),
  - `pheromone-prime --compact` and `colony-prime --compact`.
- `queen-init` creates `.aether/QUEEN.md` (not `.aether/docs/QUEEN.md`).
- `queen-read` and `colony-prime` read from `~/.aether/QUEEN.md` and `.aether/QUEEN.md`.
- `queen-promote` writes to `.aether/QUEEN.md`.
- `build.md` and `continue.md` are now orchestrators that load split playbooks under `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/`.
- Orchestrators run playbooks as staged instruction sets (Read-tool execution model), not as bash subcommand wrappers.
- Cross-platform surfaces are present:
  - 46 Claude commands and 46 OpenCode commands
  - 24 Claude agents and 24 OpenCode agents
  - 24 Codex agents (TOML format, no separate command files -- uses CODEX.md)
  - 28 Codex skills (10 colony + 18 domain)
- Autopilot subcommands (`autopilot-init`, `autopilot-update`, `autopilot-status`, `autopilot-stop`, `autopilot-check-replan`) manage autonomous build/continue cycles via `/ant:run`.
- `registry-list` lists all registered repos with metadata including domain tags.
- `.aether/agents-claude/*.md` mirrors `.claude/agents/ant/*.md` for packaging/distribution.
- `npm run lint:sync` enforces:
  - command parity checks,
  - Claude/OpenCode agent structural parity (count + filenames),
  - Claude/`.aether` agent mirror exact parity (count + filenames + content hash),
  - Codex/`.aether` agent mirror exact parity (count + filenames + content hash).
- File contents between Claude and OpenCode command/agent files currently differ; parity is structural, not byte-identical.

## Canonical Read Order (For Contributors)

When determining "how Aether works now", read in this order:

1. `.aether/aether CLI`
2. `.claude/commands/ant/build.md` and `.claude/commands/ant/continue.md`
3. `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/*.md`
4. `.claude/agents/ant/*.md`
5. Remaining `.claude/commands/ant/*.md`
6. `.opencode/commands/ant/*.md` and `.opencode/agents/*.md` (for cross-surface checks)
7. `.codex/CODEX.md` and `.codex/agents/*.toml` (for Codex surface checks)
8. `README.md` and `.aether/docs/*.md`

## Maintenance Rules

1. If runtime behavior changes, update command specs in the same PR.
2. If command specs change, update docs in the same PR.
3. Docs must never introduce paths/types not accepted by runtime.
4. Treat this file as the index of authority boundaries.
5. Keep `.aether/agents-claude/*.md` synchronized with `.claude/agents/ant/*.md` (enforced by `npm run lint:sync`).
6. Keep `.aether/agents-codex/*.toml` synchronized with `.codex/agents/*.toml`.
