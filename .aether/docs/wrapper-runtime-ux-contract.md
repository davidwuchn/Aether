# Wrapper-Runtime UX Contract

Updated: 2026-04-19

This contract defines the ownership boundary between the Go runtime and the
platform wrapper layer (Claude Code, OpenCode). It ensures wrappers enhance
presentation and execute platform-only Task-tool spawns without duplicating
runtime planning logic or drifting from runtime truth.

Use the Go `aether` CLI as the source of truth for runtime behavior. Wrappers
add presentation, pacing, and platform-owned Task-tool execution on top of that
runtime contract.

## Runtime Surface (Go — Authoritative)

The Go runtime owns ALL of the following. Wrappers must never replicate them:

### State Management
- Colony state transitions (READY → EXECUTING → BUILT → COMPLETED)
- Phase advancement and gating
- Session tracking and freshness detection
- File locking and concurrent access

### Build/Continue Workflow
- Build manifest generation (`cmd/codex_build.go`)
- Worker dispatch planning and wave allocation
- External worker finalization (`aether build-finalize`)
- Verification step execution
- Gate evaluation (security, quality, coverage, performance)
- Claims collection and persistence
- Continue verification, signal housekeeping, and advancement

### Visual Rendering
- All banner, progress bar, and status formatting (`cmd/codex_visuals.go`)
- ANSI color handling and terminal capability detection
- Caste emoji/color maps and identity rendering
- Spawn plan visualization
- Phase/task status display

### Structured Output
The runtime exposes two output modes:

| Mode | Env Var | Consumer | Content |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| JSON | `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json` | Machines, tests | Structured data envelopes |
| Visual | `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual` | Terminals, humans | Formatted ANSI output |

JSON output includes: state, phases, tasks, dispatches, verification results,
gates, claims, housekeeping, blockers, and next-step suggestions.

Visual output is the JSON data rendered through `codex_visuals.go` functions.

## Wrapper Additions (Markdown — Enhancement)

Wrappers MAY add the following on top of runtime output:

### Pre-Build Context
- Colony atmosphere (Queen persona, ant metaphor)
- Current phase context (what we're building and why)
- Pheromone signal summary (what guidance is active)
- Historical context (what previous phases accomplished)

### During-Build Narration
- Explaining what workers are doing in plain language
- Status updates with colony framing
- Noting when workers encounter issues

### Task-Tool Execution Bridge
- Requesting the build dispatch manifest with
  `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether build <phase> --plan-only`
- Spawning Claude/OpenCode agents from `result.dispatch_manifest`
- Recording live visibility with `aether spawn-log` and `aether spawn-complete`
- Sending terminal worker results back through
  `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=json aether build-finalize <phase> --completion-file <file>`

### Post-Build Summary
- What was accomplished in colony terms
- Key decisions made during the phase
- What the verification found
- What the next phase will address

### Follow-Up Guidance
- Suggesting pheromone signals for steering
- Recommending focus areas for upcoming phases
- Highlighting risks or blockers the user should know about

## Wrapper Anti-Patterns (Prohibited)

Wrappers MUST NOT:

1. **Mutate state files** — Never write to COLONY_STATE.json, session.json,
   pheromones.json, or any file in `.aether/data/` directly.

2. **Replay runtime logic** — Never duplicate build dispatch planning,
   verification sequencing, gate evaluation, or phase advancement logic.
   Wrappers may spawn the exact workers from `dispatch_manifest`; they must not
   invent the worker mix.

3. **Parse visual text as truth** — Never scrape ANSI-formatted output to
   extract state information. Use JSON mode if programmatic data is needed.

4. **Duplicate verification** — Never re-implement test running, security
   scanning, coverage analysis, or quality gating.

5. **Override runtime routing** — Never contradict the runtime's next-step
   suggestions. Wrappers may suggest alternatives but must present the
   runtime's recommendation first.

6. **Add unsanctioned menus** — Never create option menus or recovery paths
   that don't come from the runtime itself.

## Codex Platform

Codex is a special case because it does NOT use wrapper markdown:

- Codex interacts directly with the Go CLI
- All Codex UX comes from the runtime visual renderer
- Codex agents are defined in `.codex/agents/*.toml`, not slash commands
- Improvements to Codex UX must target `cmd/codex_visuals.go`
- Codex should NOT simulate wrapper behavior in its agents

## Source Chain

```
.aether/commands/*.yaml          ← Source definitions (name, runtime command, guardrails)
    ↓ (generation)
.claude/commands/ant/*.md        ← Claude Code wrappers
.opencode/commands/ant/*.md      ← OpenCode wrappers
    ↓ (delegation)
cmd/codex_*.go                   ← Go runtime (authoritative execution)
cmd/codex_visuals.go             ← Visual renderer (authoritative presentation)
```

The current repo does not check in a wrapper generator. The maintained contract
is YAML-backed manual sync plus automated parity and provenance tests.

## Enforcement

- Tests in `cmd/codex_visuals_test.go` verify visual output correctness
- YAML source files in `.aether/commands/` define wrapper boundaries
- `source-of-truth-map.md` documents the ownership hierarchy
- CLAUDE.md and CODEX.md reference this contract
