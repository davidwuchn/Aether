## User Preferences

Communication style, expertise level, and decision-making patterns observed from the user (the Queen). These shape how the colony communicates and what it prioritizes. User decisions are the most important wisdom.


- [charter] **Intent**: Add commit message synthesis and push prompts to Aether phase completion and seal workflows (Colony: Aether Colony)
- [charter] **Vision**: When a phase finishes or a colony seals, the system synthesizes a meaningful commit message from what was built, prompts the user to commit, and at seal time also prompts to push to remote (Colony: Aether Colony)
---

## Codebase Patterns

Validated approaches that work in this codebase, and anti-patterns to avoid. Includes architecture conventions, naming patterns, error handling style, and technology-specific insights. Tagged [repo] for project-specific or [general] for cross-colony patterns.

- [general] **Use explicit jq if/elif chains instead of the // operator when checking fields that can legitimately be false** (source: colony 1771335865738, 2026-03-20)

- [hive] When creating testimonials, press bars, or review content: Use clearly labeled placeholders instead of fabricating content — mark sections as 'Your real testimonial here' or similar (cross-colony, confidence: 0.95)
- [hive] When implementing pricing or booking flow: Never display session prices — route all booking interest through contact/enquiry forms. Contact-first model. (cross-colony, confidence: 0.95)
- [hive] When Deploying files via SFTP to Cloudways: Use -oPreferredAuthentications=password flags for Cloudways SFTP (cross-colony, confidence: 0.9)
- [hive] When Verifying deployed changes on Cloudways: Use ?nocache= to bypass Varnish when verifying deploys (cross-colony, confidence: 0.9)
- [hive] When building bash utilities with scoring/accumulation loops: use process substitution (&lt; &lt;(jq)) not pipes to while loops — pipes create subshells that lose variable modifications (cross-colony, confidence: 0.85)
- [charter] **Governance**: CI/CD pipeline active -- ensure all checks pass before merging (Colony: Aether Colony)
- [charter] **Goal**: Ship two targeted changes: (1) continue/advance flow generates commit message and prompts user (2) seal flow prompts commit + push to remote (Colony: Aether Colony)

## Build Learnings

What worked and what failed during builds. Captures the full picture of colony experience -- successes, failures, and adjustments. Each entry includes the phase where it was learned.



### Phase 0: migration-test
- [repo] QUEEN.md v2 migration validated -- *Phase 0 (migration-test)* (2026-03-24)
---

## Instincts

High-confidence behavioral patterns that have been validated through repeated colony work. Auto-promoted when confidence reaches 0.8 or higher. These represent the colony's deepest learned behaviors.

- [instinct] **testing** (0.85): When codebase changes, then always run full test suite after module extraction
