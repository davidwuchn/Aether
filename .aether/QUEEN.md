## User Preferences

Communication style, expertise level, and decision-making patterns observed from the user (the Queen). These shape how the colony communicates and what it prioritizes. User decisions are the most important wisdom.

- **test-colony** (2026-03-29T06:03:45Z): test content

- [charter] **Intent**: Fix critical midden entries (spawn-tree O(n^2), queen-promote newline destruction, JSON ant names), reduce aether-utils.sh bug-fix ratio through targeted fixes, update 4 high-CVE dependencies (mini... (Colony: Aether Colony)
- [charter] **Vision**: Harden Aether operational foundations -- fix the bugs that chaos testing surfaced, clean up security debt in dependencies, and make the activity log useful again as a monitoring signal. This is a s... (Colony: Aether Colony)

## Codebase Patterns

Validated approaches that work in this codebase, and anti-patterns to avoid. Includes architecture conventions, naming patterns, error handling style, and technology-specific insights. Tagged [repo] for project-specific or [general] for cross-colony patterns.

- **Aether Colony** (2026-03-30T05:45:56Z): Literal newlines break awk NF guards, CR is the testable control char for embedded content
- **Aether Colony** (2026-03-30T05:45:54Z): When adding awk gsub escaping, order matters: backslash must be first to prevent double-escaping
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:39:31Z): Oracle research finding: What would an expert change about this architecture to minimize user input while maximizing safety, verifiability, and autonomous execution capability? (80%)
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:39:23Z): Oracle research finding: How does the memory and context management system handle state persistence, session resume, context rot, and cross-colony knowledge sharing? (82%)
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:39:14Z): Oracle research finding: Where are the risk areas — execution reliability gaps, silent failures, fake autonomy, hallucination vectors, and verification weaknesses? (82%)
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:39:04Z): Oracle research finding: What are the dependency relationships between components, and where are coupling risks? (82%)

- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:38:46Z): Position-aware path exclusion (first-segment-only) is needed when a directory name appears at multiple depths
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:38:41Z): Distribution pipeline has three independent exclusion layers — verify each separately
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:38:37Z): SCRIPT_DIR references in test harness setup are easily missed when updating main path constants — grep separately
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T17:38:33Z): Anchor .npmignore patterns with leading slash when directory name appears at multiple depths
- **1774204068** (2026-03-29T02:47:07Z): Separate infrastructure from state using distinct directory variables when moving scripts

- **1774047872** (2026-03-29T02:45:53Z): Combining related subcommands into a single builder produces consistent APIs
- **1774047872** (2026-03-29T02:45:46Z): When fixing one bug check surrounding lines for related bugs from the same commit
- **1774047872** (2026-03-29T02:45:38Z): Archaeologist pre-build scans catch latent bugs in recently-added code
- **1774047872** (2026-03-29T02:45:30Z): Chaos resilience moderate: confidence cap correct, special chars safe, zero-instincts seal works. Medium: unbound var crash on missing flag values
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:45:21Z): Documentation chaos testing catches gaps between documented behavior and actual code
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:45:13Z): Confidence tier calculations should be inside atomic jq pipelines to preserve lock safety
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:45:06Z): Dead code variables (declared but never used) should be caught by auditor and either removed or implemented
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:44:59Z): Archaeology pre-build scans catch API contract mismatches (--instinct vs --text) that would silently fail at runtime
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:44:52Z): Chaos resilience strong: 5 scenarios tested, hive promotion handles empty instincts, special chars in paths, boundary confidence values correctly
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:44:45Z): Domain filtering in colony-prime uses hive-read with domain_tags from registry
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:44:38Z): Text transformation placeholders should avoid angle brackets to prevent double-escaping
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:44:32Z): Orchestrator commands should delegate to sibling subcommands via bash $0 rather than duplicating logic
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:44:25Z): Content sanitization pattern from pheromone-write is reusable for any user-supplied text input
- **1774004031** (2026-03-29T02:44:18Z): Hub-level shared files need hub-level locks — per-repo LOCK_DIR cannot protect cross-repo resources
- **1773987784** (2026-03-29T02:44:12Z): Two wisdom extraction functions must be updated in lockstep
- **1773987784** (2026-03-29T02:44:06Z): Colony-prime token budget 8000 chars matches measured output of 2000-5000 chars
- **1773987784** (2026-03-29T02:44:01Z): Prompt injection regex needs multi-word support with optional groups
- **1774650429** (2026-03-29T02:42:42Z): Audit reports must use actual test output counts, not builder-claimed counts — always cross-verify bash test pass rates against live test-aether-utils.sh output
- **1774650429** (2026-03-29T02:06:34Z): awk NF==7 for spawn detection and $3 match for completion detection handles pipes-in-summary edge cases

- **1774650429** (2026-03-29T01:57:37Z): Chaos resilience strong: 4/5 scenarios resilient for spawn-tree awk rewrite, 1 medium finding on newline edge case
- **1774650429** (2026-03-29T01:11:51Z): Inserted phase 6 (Stabilize spawn-tree parsing and JSON output): Fix all 3 spawn-tree blockers: (1) Fix O(n^2) parse_spawn_tree scaling that causes test timeouts, (2) JSON-escape ant names before interpolation into JSON output strings, (3) Add structural JSON validation in spawn-tree-load before passing through json_ok
- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T23:56:11Z): JSON injection in spawn.sh persists despite being identified as an instinct — pattern recurs because the fix was applied only to queen.sh, not spawn.sh
- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T23:56:09Z): Lifecycle commands (init, seal, entomb) properly handle colony_version through template system — init uses colony-state.template.json, seal has 12 references, entomb reads and displays it
- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T03:45:43Z): Every atomic mv that overwrites a critical file must have a non-empty size guard to prevent data destruction from upstream pipeline failures
- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T03:45:41Z): Shell functions using sed c-command for line replacement must use head/tail instead to handle multi-line content safely on macOS BSD sed
- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T00:14:55Z): Shell functions that embed user-derived values in JSON output strings must use jq for safe construction to prevent JSON injection from special characters
- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T00:14:51Z): Shell functions that set traps must compose with _aether_exit_cleanup to avoid orphaning file locks and temp files when the function exits abnormally
- **1774650429** (2026-03-27T23:20:16Z): Test fixtures with hardcoded dates will break as calendar time advances — use dynamic date computation with cross-platform fallbacks instead
- **1774650429** (2026-03-27T23:14:32Z): Chaos resilience moderate: 5 scenarios tested on pheromone-expire date fix, 3 resilient, 2 findings (static fallback staleness, double date failure)
- **1774645519** (2026-03-27T21:50:42Z): Inserted phase 5 (Stabilize caste emojis in spawn and phase displays): Add caste emojis to all ant spawn announcements and phase header displays across all commands — every spawn shows its caste emoji and phase headers include visual emoji markers
- [general] **Use explicit jq if/elif chains instead of the // operator when checking fields that can legitimately be false** (source: colony 1771335865738, 2026-03-20)

- [hive] When creating testimonials, press bars, or review content: Use clearly labeled placeholders instead of fabricating content — mark sections as 'Your real testimonial here' or similar (cross-colony, confidence: 0.95)
- [hive] When implementing pricing or booking flow: Never display session prices — route all booking interest through contact/enquiry forms. Contact-first model. (cross-colony, confidence: 0.95)
- [hive] When Deploying files via SFTP to Cloudways: Use -oPreferredAuthentications=password flags for Cloudways SFTP (cross-colony, confidence: 0.9)
- [hive] When Verifying deployed changes on Cloudways: Use ?nocache= to bypass Varnish when verifying deploys (cross-colony, confidence: 0.9)
- [hive] When building bash utilities with scoring/accumulation loops: use process substitution (&lt; &lt;(jq)) not pipes to while loops — pipes create subshells that lose variable modifications (cross-colony, confidence: 0.85)
- [charter] **Governance**: CI/CD pipeline active -- ensure all checks pass before merging (Colony: Aether Colony)

## Build Learnings

What worked and what failed during builds. Captures the full picture of colony experience -- successes, failures, and adjustments. Each entry includes the phase where it was learned.



### Phase 0: migration-test
- [repo] QUEEN.md v2 migration validated -- *Phase 0 (migration-test)* (2026-03-24)

### Phase 6: Stabilize spawn-tree parsing and JSON output
- [general] Replacing bash while-read+sed loops with single-pass awk eliminates O(n^2) subprocess forking — 4000+ forks reduced to 1 awk process, runtime from 23s to 1.7s -- *Phase 6 (Stabilize spawn-tree parsing and JSON output)* (2026-03-29)
- [general] awk NF==7 for spawn detection and $3 match for completion detection handles pipes-in-summary edge cases that pipe-counting cannot -- *Phase 6 (Stabilize spawn-tree parsing and JSON output)* (2026-03-29)
---

## Instincts

High-confidence behavioral patterns that have been validated through repeated colony work. Auto-promoted when confidence reaches 0.8 or higher. These represent the colony's deepest learned behaviors.

- [instinct] **testing** (0.85): When codebase changes, then always run full test suite after module extraction

- [instinct] **testing** (0.8): When test fixtures use hardcoded dates, then replace with dynamic cross-platform date computation to prevent time-based test degradation
- [instinct] **code-style** (0.8): When shell functions set EXIT/TERM traps, then compose trap with _aether_exit_cleanup to preserve lock and temp file cleanup on abnormal exit
- [instinct] **code-style** (0.85): When shell scripts use sed c-command for line replacement, then replace with head/tail pattern for cross-platform newline safety — sed c breaks on macOS BSD with multi-line content
- [instinct] **code-style** (0.85): When atomic mv overwrites a critical data file, then add non-empty size guard (if [[ ! -s file ]]) before mv to prevent data destruction from upstream pipeline failures
- [instinct] **code-style** (0.85): When bash scripts use while-read+sed/cut loops for file parsing, then replace with single-pass awk to eliminate O(n^2) subprocess forking
- [instinct] **code-style** (0.85): When bash scripts use while-read+sed/cut loops for file parsing, then replace with single-pass awk to eliminate O(n^2) subprocess forking — awk has associative arrays even when bash 3.2 does not
- [instinct] **workflow** (0.85): When builder produces audit or summary report with test metrics, then cross-verify all pass/fail counts against live test output before accepting report as complete — builder claims are not authoritative
- [instinct] **workflow** (0.8): When resilience testing (chaos ant) finds data accuracy issues in builder output, then always cross-verify builder claims against live test/command output before accepting — chaos findings on data accuracy should be treated as blockers
