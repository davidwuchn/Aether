## User Preferences

Communication style, expertise level, and decision-making patterns observed from the user (the Queen). These shape how the colony communicates and what it prioritizes. User decisions are the most important wisdom.


- [charter] **Intent**: Comprehensive audit of today's session work — verify QUEEN.md, pheromone system, wisdom pipeline, charter-write, and all colony lifecycle changes are functioning correctly (Colony: Aether Colony)
- [charter] **Vision**: Confirm that everything built across three colonies today (versioning, seal audit fixes, visual consistency) works end-to-end with no regressions, silent failures, or data loss (Colony: Aether Colony)

## Codebase Patterns

Validated approaches that work in this codebase, and anti-patterns to avoid. Includes architecture conventions, naming patterns, error handling style, and technology-specific insights. Tagged [repo] for project-specific or [general] for cross-colony patterns.

- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T00:14:55Z): Shell functions that embed user-derived values in JSON output strings must use jq for safe construction to prevent JSON injection from special characters
- **1774650429** (2026-03-28T00:14:51Z): Shell functions that set traps must compose with _aether_exit_cleanup to avoid orphaning file locks and temp files when the function exits abnormally
- **1774650429** (2026-03-27T23:20:16Z): Test fixtures with hardcoded dates will break as calendar time advances — use dynamic date computation with cross-platform fallbacks instead
- **1774650429** (2026-03-27T23:14:32Z): Chaos resilience moderate: 5 scenarios tested on pheromone-expire date fix, 3 resilient, 2 findings (static fallback staleness, double date failure)
- **1774645519** (2026-03-27T21:50:42Z): Inserted phase 5 (Stabilize caste emojis in spawn and phase displays): Add caste emojis to all ant spawn announcements and phase header displays across all commands — every spawn shows its caste emoji and phase headers include visual emoji markers
- [general] **Use explicit jq if/elif chains instead of the // operator when checking fields that can legitimately be false** (source: colony 1771335865738, 2026-03-20)

- [hive] When creating testimonials, press bars, or review content: Use clearly labeled placeholders instead of fabricating content — mark sections as 'Your real testimonial here' or similar (cross-colony, confidence: 0.95)
- [hive] When implementing pricing or booking flow: Never display session prices — route all booking interest through contact/enquiry forms. Contact-first model. (cross-colony, confidence: 0.95)
- [hive] When Deploying files via SFTP to Cloudways: Use -oPreferredAuthentications=password flags for Cloudways SFTP (cross-colony, confidence: 0.9)
- [hive] When Verifying deployed changes on Cloudways: Use ?nocache= to bypass Varnish when verifying deploys (cross-colony, confidence: 0.9)
- [hive] When building bash utilities with scoring/accumulation loops: use process substitution (&lt; &lt;(jq)) not pipes to while loops — pipes create subshells that lose variable modifications (cross-colony, confidence: 0.85)
- [charter] **Governance**: CI/CD pipeline active — ensure all checks pass before merging (Colony: Aether Colony)

## Build Learnings

What worked and what failed during builds. Captures the full picture of colony experience -- successes, failures, and adjustments. Each entry includes the phase where it was learned.



### Phase 0: migration-test
- [repo] QUEEN.md v2 migration validated -- *Phase 0 (migration-test)* (2026-03-24)
---

## Instincts

High-confidence behavioral patterns that have been validated through repeated colony work. Auto-promoted when confidence reaches 0.8 or higher. These represent the colony's deepest learned behaviors.

- [instinct] **testing** (0.85): When codebase changes, then always run full test suite after module extraction

- [instinct] **testing** (0.8): When test fixtures use hardcoded dates, then replace with dynamic cross-platform date computation to prevent time-based test degradation
- [instinct] **code-style** (0.8): When shell functions set EXIT/TERM traps, then compose trap with _aether_exit_cleanup to preserve lock and temp file cleanup on abnormal exit
