# Colony Lifecycle

## Purpose

Every command must leave the user with a clear next action. No dead ends. The colony has a defined state machine, and every output must orient the user within it.

## Literal CLI Commands

When the user message is already a literal `aether ...` command, treat it as an instruction to run that command directly.

- Do not inspect repo files first to infer what the command "might mean".
- Do not translate the command into `/ant-` language in Codex.
- Use `aether --help` or `aether <subcommand> --help` only to confirm availability or flags.
- Treat the installed `aether` binary as the source of truth if docs and runtime disagree.
- If the binary does not expose a documented command, say so plainly and follow the binary's actual command surface.
- When invoking lifecycle commands through Codex shell execution, prefer `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether ...` unless the user explicitly wants JSON.
- Do not prepend exploratory narration like "I'm checking the repo" or "I'm treating this as..."
- Do not append a generic "Next Up" explanation when the CLI already printed the result.
- For read-only commands like `aether status`, `aether history`, `aether version`, or `aether pheromones`, your own post-command summary should be zero or one short sentence.

## State Machine

The colony progresses through these states in order:

```
IDLE -> READY -> PLANNING -> EXECUTING -> SEALED -> ENTOMBED -> IDLE
```

In Codex, the authoritative runtime values in `COLONY_STATE.json` are `IDLE`,
`READY`, `EXECUTING`, `BUILT`, and `COMPLETED`. Terms like "planning",
"sealed", and "entombed" describe lifecycle moments and next steps, not always
literal persisted state values.

| State | Meaning | Entered By | Next Action |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| IDLE | No active colony | Default / after entomb | `/ant-init` or `aether init` |
| READY | Colony initialized, no plan | `/ant-init` or `aether init` | `/ant-plan` or `aether plan` |
| PLANNING | Plan being generated | `/ant-plan` or `aether plan` | `/ant-build 1` or `aether build 1` |
| EXECUTING | Phases being built | `/ant-build` or `aether build` | `/ant-continue` or `aether continue` |
| SEALED | Colony marked complete | `/ant-seal` or `aether seal` | `/ant-entomb` or `aether entomb` |
| ENTOMBED | Colony archived | `/ant-entomb` or `aether entomb` | `/ant-init` or `aether init` (new goal) |

## Next Up Block

Every command output must end with a "Next Up" block. This block tells the user exactly what to do next based on the current state.

Literal CLI exception:
- If the `aether` CLI already rendered the result, do not restate the same guidance in a second synthetic "Next Up" block.
- Only add your own next-step note when the CLI output is missing, failed, or ambiguous.

### Format

```
━━ N E X T   U P ━━
Run `aether continue` to verify work and advance to the next phase.
```

### Rules

- Always include the exact command to run, with any arguments.
- If multiple valid next actions exist, list the primary one first, then alternatives.
- Match the Next Up to the current state -- never suggest a command that is invalid for the current state.
- After seal, suggest entomb. After entomb, suggest init with a new goal.
- Never output a command result without a Next Up block.

### State-Specific Next Up Examples

| Current State | Primary Next Up | Alternatives |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| READY | `aether plan` | `aether colonize` (if existing code) |
| PLANNING | `aether build 1` | `aether focus` / `aether redirect` (to set signals first) |
| EXECUTING (just built) | `aether continue` | `aether status` (to review) |
| EXECUTING (just verified) | `aether build N+1` | `aether seal` (if last phase) |
| SEALED | `aether entomb` | -- |
| ENTOMBED | `aether init "new goal"` | -- |

## Command Chaining Awareness

Commands feed into each other. When producing output, be aware of what the previous command was and what the next one expects:

- `init` creates state that `plan` reads.
- `plan` creates phases that `build` executes.
- `build` creates artifacts that `continue` verifies.
- `continue` advances state that the next `build` reads.

If a command detects that prerequisite state is missing (e.g., `build` called with no plan), display a clear error explaining what to run first, not a cryptic failure message.

## Dead End Prevention

Before finalizing any command output, check: "Does this output end with a Next Up block?" If not, add one. There are zero valid cases where a command should leave the user without guidance on what to do next.
