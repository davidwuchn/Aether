## Current Goal

Comprehensive Aether colony review across the last three GSD milestones: v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2. Audit whether the full system is actually working properly across Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex CLI. Review runtime truth, worker dispatch and lifecycle, agent spawning visibility, caste identity, build/plan/colonize/continue/watch/status behavior, recovery and partial-success flows, context proof, skill routing, prompt integrity, wrapper honesty, install/update/versioning, and cross-platform parity. Verify that Claude/OpenCode ceremony is runtime-backed rather than fake, Codex reflects the same truth model, and all major implementations were completed correctly. Findings first: identify bugs, regressions, misleading UX, parity gaps, stale docs, missing tests, or anything not truly working as intended.

## Tasks For Phase 6 — End-to-end verification

- [x] Add tests that prove colonize, plan, build, and continue record real worker activity
- [x] Run a live colony loop and compare its outputs with the documented ant process

## Next Steps

1. Run `aether entomb`
2. Run `aether phase --number 6` to inspect the tracked phase details
3. Run `aether resume-colony` after a context clear if you want the full recovery view

---

## If Context Collapses

1. Run `aether resume` for the quick dashboard restore
2. Run `aether resume-colony` for the full handoff and task view
3. Read `.aether/HANDOFF.md` if a richer session summary was persisted
