## Current Goal

Restore the agent spawning bridge — bring back full ceremony, real agent dispatch via Agent tool, all worker castes (Archaeologist, Oracle, Architect, Ambassador, Builder waves, Watcher, Measurer, Chaos, Scout), depth prompts, named workers with caste colors, graveyard/midden system, QUEEN.md wisdom pipeline, hive brain, skill injection, cross-agent context flow, tiered escalation, and visually rich output with emojis and caste identity. The Go runtime manages state and produces structured dispatch plans; the markdown wrappers must read those plans and spawn real workers. Everything that made v5.4 feel alive, rebuilt on top of the current Go runtime.

## What's In Progress

Blended v1.6 ceremony revival plan persisted: Go owns state/events, TypeScript narrator owns visuals, wrappers own real Task-tool spawning. Current persisted colony phase: Assumptions and gap audit.

Detailed handoff note: `.aether/dreams/2026-04-24-ceremony-revival-v1.6-handoff.md`.

Important continuity distinction: structured colony state has not advanced past Phase 1. Git commits and `.aether/docs/ceremony-revival-v1.6-handoff.md` are the branch implementation progress source of truth. Do not manually edit `COLONY_STATE.json` to match code progress; advance it only through normal Aether lifecycle commands if needed.

Integrated review findings: Keeper continuity fixes; Auditor stream timeout/pagination fixes; Gatekeeper explicit `.aether/ts` embed, nested `node_modules` exclusion, CI/release/dependabot coverage, package license, and runtime-not-wired warning; Watcher phase-plan mirror and real TypeScript narrator tests.

Implemented Phase 2/3 foundation: narrator runtime ships as dependency-free `.aether/ts/dist/narrator.js`; `npm ci` is only for developer/CI checks, not installed runtime use. The narrator consumes Go-owned `visuals-dump --json` caste metadata through `--visuals`, event-bus stream output is smoke-tested through the runtime, Go auto-launch is implemented behind `AETHER_NARRATOR`, and JSON mode stays free of narrator output.

Detailed tracked handoff: `.aether/docs/ceremony-revival-v1.6-handoff.md`.

Specialist reviews for the launcher slice are complete. Scout recommended build-specific lifecycle insertion points in `cmd/codex_build_worktree.go` and `cmd/codex_build.go`. Watcher listed launcher tests for env gating, missing Node/runtime, early exits, cleanup, event persistence, and JSON non-pollution. Gatekeeper required absolute `node` + `dist/narrator.js`, no shell/npm/npx/tsx at runtime, non-fatal missing dependencies, and child stdout routed back through Go's visual output mutex. Those launcher requirements are implemented and verified.

Launcher implementation completed: `cmd/narrator_launcher.go` auto-launches the dependency-free Node sidecar for visual build output, never in JSON mode; `cmd/ceremony_emitter.go` persists build ceremony events and forwards the exact persisted event to the sidecar; `cmd/codex_build.go` and `cmd/codex_build_worktree.go` emit prewave, wave start, spawn, tool-use, and wave-end events. User-controlled event text/lists are trimmed before persistence.

Rolling display foundation completed: `.aether/ts/narrator.ts` now keeps a stateful ceremony frame and renders a `COLONY ACTIVITY` view with wave progress plus Active, Completed, Blocked, and Other worker sections. It preserves the compatibility event line first so existing Go smoke tests continue to work. `.aether/ts/dist/narrator.js` has been regenerated.

Hub fallback smoke completed in a temporary HOME: install/update synced the package, fixture-local `.aether/ts` was removed, and `AETHER_NARRATOR=on aether build 1 --synthetic` still rendered `COLONY ACTIVITY` from the installed hub runtime. TTY live redraw/debounce is intentionally deferred until real wrapper output gives a better terminal contract.

Build plan-only bridge slice completed: `aether build <phase> --plan-only` now emits a read-only JSON `dispatch_manifest` for wrapper orchestration. It validates the same buildability gates as real build, includes deterministic worker names plus `agent_name`, wave execution, playbooks, selected tasks, and success criteria, and does not mutate `COLONY_STATE.json` or write build artifacts. Focused Go tests passed.

Build finalize bridge slice completed: `aether build-finalize <phase> --completion-file <path|->` now records externally spawned wrapper Task results as `dispatch_mode: external-task`, writes the build manifest and `last-build-claims.json`, updates/creates spawn-tree statuses, sets colony state to BUILT, and points the next action at `aether continue`. This is the missing runtime-owned input packet after Claude/OpenCode wrappers spawn real agents.

Build wrapper restoration completed: `.aether/commands/build.yaml`, `.claude/commands/ant/build.md`, and `.opencode/commands/ant/build.md` now use the runtime bridge: status -> JSON `build --plan-only` -> parse `dispatch_manifest` -> load `build-wave.md` -> spawn real platform agents with manifest names/castes/waves -> `spawn-log`/`spawn-complete` -> completion JSON -> `build-finalize` -> `/ant-continue`. Wrapper tests now forbid the old visual pass-through build command.

Continue plan-only bridge slice completed: `aether continue --plan-only` now runs runtime-owned verification/claim checks and emits a read-only JSON `continue_manifest` for wrapper-spawned Watcher, Gatekeeper, Auditor, and Probe agents. It does not mutate state, write continue reports, or spawn Go-side review workers. `continue-finalize` remains the next runtime surface.

Continue finalize bridge slice completed: `aether continue-finalize --completion-file <path|->` now re-loads current state, re-runs verification and claim checks, merges wrapper Watcher/Gatekeeper/Auditor/Probe results, writes verification/gate/review/continue reports, records continue worker flow without duplicating wrapper spawn-log entries, and advances or blocks through the existing runtime gates and atomic state transition.

Continue wrapper restoration completed: `.aether/commands/continue.yaml`, `.claude/commands/ant/continue.md`, and `.opencode/commands/ant/continue.md` now use the runtime bridge: status -> JSON `continue --plan-only` -> parse `continue_manifest` -> spawn Watcher first, then Gatekeeper/Auditor/Probe with manifest names/castes/waves -> `spawn-log`/`spawn-complete` -> completion JSON -> `continue-finalize` -> route to `/ant-build N+1`, `/ant-continue`, or `/ant-seal`. Wrapper tests now forbid the old visual pass-through continue command.

Plan plan-only bridge slice completed: `aether plan --plan-only --depth <fast|balanced|deep|exhaustive>` now emits a read-only JSON `plan_manifest`/`planning_manifest` for wrapper-spawned Scout and Route-Setter agents. Depth maps to existing plan granularity: fast=sprint, balanced=milestone, deep=quarter, exhaustive=major. It does not mutate colony state, write planning artifacts, or spawn Go-side planning workers. `plan-finalize` remains the next runtime surface.

Plan finalize bridge slice completed: `aether plan-finalize --completion-file <path|->` now consumes the wrapper planning manifest plus terminal Scout/Route-Setter results, validates manifest/state/dispatch identity, writes canonical SCOUT/ROUTE-SETTER/phase-plan/phase-research artifacts, records spawn-tree statuses, updates colony state to READY with the selected plan granularity, and routes to the first build phase.

Plan wrapper restoration completed: `.aether/commands/plan.yaml`, `.claude/commands/ant/plan.md`, and `.opencode/commands/ant/plan.md` now use the runtime bridge: depth ceremony -> status -> JSON `plan --plan-only --depth <choice>` -> parse `plan_manifest`/`planning_manifest` -> spawn Scout wave 1 then Route-Setter wave 2 -> `spawn-log`/`spawn-complete` -> completion JSON -> `plan-finalize` -> route to `/ant-build 1`. Wrapper tests now forbid the old direct visual plan pass-through.

Phase 4 specialist execution-plan slice is in the working tree: `dispatch_manifest` now includes `execution_plan`, each dispatch includes `execution_wave`, full builds sequence Archaeologist/Oracle/Architect/conditional Ambassador before builder/scout waves and Probe/Watcher/Measurer/Chaos after them, and Claude/OpenCode wrappers execute the runtime-owned execution plan. Task-scoped redispatch remains narrow.

TypeScript lifecycle-context rendering slice is in the working tree: `.aether/ts/narrator.ts` now treats `ceremony.<stage>.wave.start/end` generically, tracks non-build stages in the activity title, and keeps skill, pheromone, and chamber events visible in a short `Context` section. `.aether/ts/test/narrator.test.ts` covers continue-style wave events plus skill/pheromone/chamber notices, and `.aether/ts/dist/narrator.js` has been regenerated. Tracked details are in `.aether/docs/ceremony-revival-v1.6-handoff.md`.

Broad checkpoint verification passed on 2026-04-24T11:27:54Z: TS install/typecheck/test/build, `gofmt`, `git diff --check`, `go test ./cmd -count=1`, `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 300s`, and `go vet ./...`.

GitHub PR status: previous PR #5 for this branch is already merged/closed and only covered the early branch state through `c1880184`. Current draft PR is #6: `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether/pull/6`. The branch has merged the PR #5 squash commit from `main` with an ancestry-only merge because `origin/main` already matched the branch's `c1880184` tree.

## Next Steps

1. Push the PR/status handoff update
2. Confirm PR #6 is no longer conflicting after the ancestry-only merge
3. Continue in order with live build wrapper smoke, then lifecycle event emission
4. Keep Go as state/event source of truth; wrappers own Task-tool spawning

---

## If Context Collapses

1. Run `aether resume` for the quick dashboard restore
2. Run `aether resume-colony` for the full handoff and task view
3. Read `.aether/HANDOFF.md` if a richer session summary was persisted

### Active Todos
- Live smoke the build wrapper path with real platform agents
