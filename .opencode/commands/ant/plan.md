### Step -1: Normalize Arguments

Run: `normalized_args=$(bash .aether/aether-utils.sh normalize-args "$@")`

This ensures arguments work correctly in both Claude Code and OpenCode. Use `$normalized_args` throughout this command.


You are the **Queen**. Orchestrate research and planning until the selected confidence target is reached within the selected iteration budget.

## Instructions

Parse `$normalized_args`:
- If contains `--no-visual`: set `visual_mode = false` (visual is ON by default)
- Otherwise: set `visual_mode = true`

### Step 1: Read State

Read `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json`.

**Auto-upgrade old state:**
If `version` field is missing, "1.0", or "2.0":
1. Preserve: `goal`, `state`, `current_phase`, `plan.phases`
2. Write upgraded v3.0 state (same structure as /ant:init but preserving data)
3. Output: `State auto-upgraded to v3.0`
4. Continue with command.

Extract: `goal`, `plan.phases`

**Validate:** If `goal: null`:
```
No colony initialized. Run /ant:init "<goal>" first.
```
Stop here.

### Step 1.5: Load State and Show Resumption Context

Run using Bash tool: `bash .aether/aether-utils.sh load-state`

If successful and goal is not null:
1. Extract current_phase from state
2. Get phase name from plan.phases[current_phase - 1].name (or "(unnamed)")
3. Display brief resumption context:
   ```
   🔄 Resuming: Phase X - Name
   ```

If .aether/HANDOFF.md exists (detected in load-state output):
- Display "Resuming from paused session"
- Read .aether/HANDOFF.md for additional context
- Remove .aether/HANDOFF.md after display (cleanup)

Run: `bash .aether/aether-utils.sh unload-state` to release lock.

**Error handling:**
- If E_FILE_NOT_FOUND: "No colony initialized. Run /ant:init first." and stop
- If validation error: Display error details with recovery suggestion and stop
- For other errors: Display generic error and suggest /ant:status for diagnostics

### Step 2: Check Existing Plan

If `plan.phases` has entries (non-empty array), skip to **Step 6** (Display Plan).

Parse `$normalized_args`:
- If contains `--accept`: Set `force_accept = true` (accept current plan regardless of confidence)
- Otherwise: `force_accept = false`

Select planning depth (prompt user if not explicitly provided):
- Presets:
  - `fast`: `target_confidence = 80`, `max_iterations = 4`
  - `balanced`: `target_confidence = 90`, `max_iterations = 6`
  - `deep`: `target_confidence = 95`, `max_iterations = 8`
  - `exhaustive`: `target_confidence = 99`, `max_iterations = 12`
- Preset selectors:
  - `--fast`, `--balanced`, `--deep`, `--exhaustive`
  - `--quality fast|balanced|deep|exhaustive`
- CLI overrides:
  - `--target <70-99>` to set `target_confidence`
  - `--max-iterations <2-12>` to set `max_iterations`
- If no preset/overrides are provided, ask:
  `Planning depth? 1) Fast 2) Balanced 3) Deep (recommended) 4) Exhaustive`
- Map user choice to a preset, default to `deep` on unclear input.
- If overrides are out of range, clamp to valid ranges and continue.

### Step 2.5: Load Compact Context Capsule

Run using the Bash tool with description "Loading compact planning context...":
```bash
bash .aether/aether-utils.sh context-capsule --compact --json 2>/dev/null
```

If JSON is valid and `.ok == true`, extract `.result.prompt_section` into `context_capsule_prompt`.
If command fails or returns invalid JSON, set `context_capsule_prompt = ""` and continue.

### Step 3: Initialize Planning State

Update watch files for tmux visibility:

Write `.aether/data/watch-status.txt`:
```
AETHER COLONY :: PLANNING
==========================

State: PLANNING
Phase: 0/0 (generating plan)
Confidence: 0%
Iteration: 0/{max_iterations}

Active Workers:
  [Research] Starting...
  [Planning] Waiting...

Last Activity:
  Planning loop initiated
```

Write `.aether/data/watch-progress.txt`:
```
Progress
========

[                    ] 0%

Target: {target_confidence}% confidence

Iteration: 0/{max_iterations}
Gaps: (analyzing...)
```

### Step 3.5: Load Territory Survey

Check if territory survey exists before research:

```bash
ls .aether/data/survey/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If survey exists:**
1. **Always read PATHOGENS.md first** — understand known concerns before planning
2. Read other relevant docs based on goal keywords:

| Goal Contains | Additional Documents |
|---------------|---------------------|
| UI, frontend, component, page | DISCIPLINES.md, CHAMBERS.md |
| API, backend, endpoint | BLUEPRINT.md, DISCIPLINES.md |
| database, schema, model | BLUEPRINT.md, PROVISIONS.md |
| test, spec | SENTINEL-PROTOCOLS.md, DISCIPLINES.md |
| integration, external | TRAILS.md, PROVISIONS.md |
| refactor, cleanup | PATHOGENS.md, BLUEPRINT.md |

**Inject survey context into scout and planner prompts:**
- Include key patterns from DISCIPLINES.md
- Reference architecture from BLUEPRINT.md
- Note tech stack from PROVISIONS.md
- Flag concerns from PATHOGENS.md

**Display:**
```
🗺️ Territory survey loaded — incorporating context into planning
```

**If no survey:** Continue without survey context (scouts will do fresh exploration)

### Step 3.6: Phase Domain Research

Investigate domain knowledge for each phase before the planning loop begins. This runs every time `/ant:plan` generates a new plan -- no skip flag.

**1. Retrieve hive wisdom for research priming:**

```bash
hive_context=$(bash .aether/aether-utils.sh hive-read --limit 5 --format text 2>/dev/null)
```

Parse the JSON result to extract `.result.text` as `hive_text`. If command fails or returns empty, set `hive_text = ""`.

**2. Clean any previous research for this phase:**

```bash
research_dir=".aether/data/phase-research"
mkdir -p "$research_dir"
rm -f "$research_dir/phase-{phase_number}-research.md"
```

Re-running /ant:plan always re-researches from scratch.

**3. Spawn Research Scout** via Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-scout"`:

FALLBACK: If "Agent type not found", use general-purpose and inject role: "You are a Scout Ant performing Phase Domain Research."

```
You are a Scout Ant performing Phase Domain Research.

--- MISSION ---
Investigate the domain knowledge needed for Phase {phase_number}: {phase_name}
Goal: "{goal}"
Phase description: "{phase_description}"

{context_capsule_prompt}

--- PRE-EXISTING COLONY WISDOM ---
{hive_text}

--- RESEARCH AREAS ---
1. Key patterns in the existing codebase relevant to this phase
2. External library/API documentation if the phase involves external tools
3. Common gotchas and pitfalls in this domain
4. Recommended implementation approach based on findings

--- SCOPE CONSTRAINTS ---
- Maximum 5 key patterns
- Maximum 3 gotchas
- Maximum 1 recommended approach paragraph
- Total output under 3000 words
- Prioritize actionable guidance over exhaustive documentation
- Check hive wisdom above first -- do not re-discover known patterns

--- TOOLS ---
Use: Glob, Grep, Read, WebSearch, WebFetch
Do NOT use: Task, Write, Edit

--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---
Return JSON:
{
  "hive_wisdom_used": ["list of hive entries that were relevant"],
  "key_patterns": [
    {"pattern": "description", "source": "file path or URL", "relevance": "why it matters for this phase"}
  ],
  "external_context": [
    {"topic": "what", "finding": "description", "source": "URL or doc reference"}
  ],
  "gotchas": [
    {"issue": "what can go wrong", "prevention": "how to avoid it", "source": "evidence"}
  ],
  "recommended_approach": "synthesis paragraph",
  "files_to_study": ["path1", "path2"]
}
```

**4. Wait for scout to complete** (blocking -- direct Task return).

**5. Parse scout JSON output and write RESEARCH.md to disk.** The Queen (plan.md orchestrator) writes the file -- scout is read-only. Write to: `.aether/data/phase-research/phase-{phase_number}-research.md`

RESEARCH.md format (6 fixed sections):

```markdown
# Phase {N} Research: {Phase Name}

**Generated:** {ISO-8601 timestamp}
**Phase:** {N} - {Phase Name}
**Research scope:** {brief summary of what was investigated}

## Hive Wisdom (Pre-existing Knowledge)
{Format hive_wisdom_used entries, or "No relevant hive wisdom found" if empty}

## Key Patterns
{Format each key_patterns entry as: **{pattern}:** {relevance} (Source: {source})}

## External Context
{Format each external_context entry as: **{topic}:** {finding} (Source: {source})}
{If empty: "No external research needed for this phase"}

## Gotchas
{Format each gotchas entry as: **{issue}:** {prevention} (Source: {source})}

## Recommended Approach
{recommended_approach text}

## Files to Study
{Format as bullet list of file paths}
```

**6. Store research findings** in a variable `research_findings_summary` for injection into the Route-Setter prompt in Step 4. This is a compact summary (not the full RESEARCH.md):

```
Key Patterns: {bullet list of pattern names}
Gotchas: {bullet list of gotcha titles}
Recommended: {recommended_approach, first sentence only}
Files: {comma-separated file paths}
```

**7. Display completion:**

```
Research complete: phase-{phase_number}-research.md ({word_count} words)
```

### Step 4: Research and Planning Loop

Initialize tracking:
- `iteration = 0`
- `confidence = 0`
- `gaps = []` (list of knowledge gaps)
- `plan_draft = null`
- `last_confidence = 0`
- `stall_count = 0` (consecutive iterations with < 5% improvement)

**Loop (max {max_iterations} iterations, 2 agents per iteration: 1 scout + 1 planner):**

```
while iteration < max_iterations AND confidence < target_confidence:
    iteration += 1

    # === AUTO-BREAK CHECKS (no user prompt needed) ===
    if iteration > 1:
        if confidence >= target_confidence:
            Log: "Confidence threshold reached ({confidence}%), finalizing plan"
            break
        if stall_count >= 2:
            Log: "Planning stalled at {confidence}%, finalizing current plan"
            break

    # === RESEARCH PHASE (always runs — 1 scout per iteration) ===

    --- PLANNING DISCIPLINE ---
    Read .aether/planning.md for full reference.

    Key rules:
    - Bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each) - one action per task
    - Goal-oriented - describe WHAT to achieve, not HOW
    - Constraints define boundaries, not implementation
    - Hints point toward patterns, not solutions
    - Success criteria are testable outcomes

    Task format (GOAL-ORIENTED):
    ```
    Task N.1: {goal description}
    Goal: What to achieve (not how)
    Constraints:
      - Boundaries and requirements
      - Integration points
    Hints:
      - Pointer to existing patterns (optional)
      - Relevant files to reference (optional)
    Success Criteria:
      - Testable outcome 1
      - Testable outcome 2
    ```

    DO NOT include:
    - Exact code to write
    - Specific function names (unless critical API)
    - Implementation details
    - Line-by-line instructions

    Workers discover implementations by reading existing code and patterns.
    This enables TRUE EMERGENCE - different approaches based on context.

Proceed directly to Step 5. No user confirmation needed — the plan auto-finalizes.

### Step 5: Finalize Plan

Once loop exits (confidence >= {target_confidence}, max iterations reached, or stall detected):

Read current COLONY_STATE.json, then update:
- Set `plan.phases` to the final phases array
- Set `plan.generated_at` to ISO-8601 timestamp
- Set `state` to `"READY"`
- Append event: `"<timestamp>|plan_generated|plan|Generated {N} phases with {confidence}% confidence"`

Write COLONY_STATE.json.

Log plan completion: `bash .aether/aether-utils.sh activity-log "PLAN_COMPLETE" "queen" "Plan finalized with {confidence}% confidence"`

Update watch-status.txt:
```
AETHER COLONY :: READY
=======================

State: READY
Plan: {N} phases generated
Confidence: {confidence}%

Ready to build.
```

### Step 6: Display Plan

Read `plan.phases` from COLONY_STATE.json and display:

```

## Confidence Scoring Reference

Each dimension rated 0-100%:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Knowledge | Understanding of codebase structure, patterns, tech stack |
| Requirements | Clarity of success criteria and acceptance conditions |
| Risks | Identification of potential blockers and failure modes |
| Dependencies | Understanding of what affects what, ordering constraints |
| Effort | Ability to estimate relative complexity of tasks |

**Overall** = weighted average (knowledge 25%, requirements 25%, risks 20%, dependencies 15%, effort 15%)

**Target:** Use the selected planning depth target. Higher targets trade latency for stronger up-front plan quality.

---

## Auto-Termination Safeguards

The planning loop terminates automatically without requiring user input:

1. **Confidence Threshold**: Loop exits when overall confidence reaches `{target_confidence}%`

2. **Hard Iteration Cap**: Maximum `{max_iterations}` iterations (2 subagents per iteration: 1 scout + 1 planner)

3. **Stall Detection**: If confidence improves < 5% for 2 consecutive iterations, auto-finalize current plan

4. **Single Scout Research**: One researcher per iteration (broad on iteration 1, gap-focused on 2+) — no parallel Alpha/Beta or synthesis agent

5. **Compressed Output**: Subagents limited to 5 findings max, 2-sentence summaries, compact JSON

6. **Escape Hatch**: `/ant:plan --accept` accepts current plan regardless of confidence
