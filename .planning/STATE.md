# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 17 — Local Wisdom Accumulation (v2.2 Living Wisdom)

## Current Position

Phase: 17 of 20 (Local Wisdom Accumulation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-24 — Completed 17-01 (QUEEN.md restructure + write subcommands)

Progress: [#####.....] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v2.1):**
- Total plans completed: 39
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 3.0 hours

**Recent Trend:**
- v2.1 completed 8 phases, 39 plans in ~3 hours
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v2.2]: Focus exclusively on wisdom systems (QUEEN.md + hive brain) — ceremony/verification improvements deferred to v2.3
- [v2.2]: QUEEN.md should populate automatically during colony work — user never touches it
- [v2.2]: Local wisdom first (phases 17-18), then cross-colony (19), then hub-level (20)
- [v2.1 feedback]: QUEEN.md and hive brain are template-only in practice — never populated with real data
- [17-01]: v2 format detection via '## Build Learnings' header presence -- no metadata version parsing needed
- [17-01]: v1 backward compat maps 6 sections to 2 v2 keys (codebase_patterns, user_prefs)
- [17-01]: New write subcommands use threshold 0 -- every build writes, no observation counting
- [17-01]: Build learnings grouped by phase subsections for readability

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- QUEEN.md wisdom promotion exists in code but doesn't fire during real colony work — need to trace actual code paths
- Hive brain has subcommands but no confirmed cross-colony data flow
- Existing queen.sh and learning.sh modules may need significant changes to support automatic accumulation
