# Project State

## Project Reference

See: [.planning/PROJECT.md](/Users/callumcowie-repos-Aether/.planning/PROJECT.md:1)

**Core value:** Aether should feel alive and truthful at runtime, not only look clever in wrappers or tests.
**Current focus:** Phase 44 — doc-alignment-and-archive-consistency

## Current Position

Phase: 44 (doc-alignment-and-archive-consistency) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: Executing Phase 44
Last activity: 2026-04-23 -- Phase 44 execution started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 22
- Total commits: 20
- All tests green (2900+ passing)

**By Plan:**

| Plan | Wave | Commits | Requirements | Key Outcome |
|------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 01 Worker Truth | 1 | 3 | R045, R046 | FakeInvoker blocked, DispatchBatch errors surface |
| 02 Continue Truth | 2 | 4 | R047, R048 | 4 bypass paths closed |
| 04 Git Claims | 3 | 3 | R049, R050 | Claims verified against git, no environmental dismissal |
| 03 Atomic State | 4 | 6 | R051 | UpdateJSONAtomically, state saved before side effects |
| Phase 34 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 0 files |
| Phase 34 P02 | 4min | 2 tasks | 0 files |

| Phase 35-platform-parity P03 | 40min | 2 tasks | 26 files |
| Phase 40-01 | 1 | 3 | PUB-01 (R059) | aether publish command, version --check |
| Phase 40-02 | 2 | 2 | PUB-01 (R059) | E2E tests, operations guide update |
| Phase 41 | 3 | 5 | PUB-02 (R060) | Channel isolation guards, tests, docs |
| Phase 43-02 | 1 | 1 | REL-02 (R063) | scanIntegrity wired into medic --deep, 14 tests, os.Exit fix |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.3 shipped with all 12 requirements satisfied (R027-R038).
- v1.4 was marked complete but found to be synthetic — runtime did not match claims. Completion retracted.
- v1.5 is a truth-recovery milestone, not feature expansion.
- Oracle audit (33 issues: 7 P0, 6 P1, 8 P2, 9 P3, 3 P4) is authoritative for scope.
- Active colony stuck in phase 2 with continue orchestration blocked.
- 6 phases defined for v1.5: 31 (P0 Truth), 32 (Continue Unblock), 33 (Dispatch Fixes), 34 (Cleanup), 35 (Parity), 36 (Release Decision).
- In-repo build claims are git-verified for ALL completed workers (R049 resolved).
- Environmental dismissal removed from verification — all failures produce honest summaries (R050 resolved).
- Integration tests prove bypass paths stay closed for verified_partial, watcher timeout, reconcile, and git claims.
- FakeInvoker blocked from production paths; real invoker requires honest platform dispatch.
- DispatchBatch error propagation ensures dispatch errors surface to callers.
- Colony state advancement is atomic via UpdateJSONAtomically; state saved before side effects and reports (R051 resolved).
- Side-effect failures after state commit do not roll back; state remains valid and consistent.
- Continue detects abandoned builds (all dispatches stuck at "spawned" >10 min) and returns blocked=true with recovery commands.
- Stale report files (verification.json, gates.json, continue.json, review.json) are cleared before continue verification runs.
- Full E2E recovery pipeline proven: abandoned detection -> re-dispatch -> verify -> advance.
- Both candidate commits (98cda871 claude-dispatch-ux, 4bbb9273 intent-workflows) evaluated and dismissed -- useful code already exists on main, no preserve branches needed
- 523 worktrees removed in strict bottom-up order with zero failures
- 259 branches deleted after all worktrees removed -- no unique commit loss
- All 18 unresolved blocker flags archived -- issues fixed by Phases 31-33 (R058 complete)
- Task 2 used an empty commit because packaging mirrors were already byte-identical to canonical sources
- No Codex mirror changes needed — TOML agents are platform-specific and were already correct
- Test refinement over agent bloat: completeness test made role-aware instead of forcing TDD/escalation into all agents
- activity-log sections removed from 16 Codex agents (OpenCode-specific, no Codex equivalent)
- flag-add deprecation check refined to only warn on bare flag-add without aether prefix
- aether publish command atomically builds binary, syncs hub, and verifies version agreement
- aether version --check returns non-zero when binary and hub versions disagree
- aether install --package-dir continues to work for backward compatibility
- Operations guide updated to document aether publish as primary path

### Phase 34 Decisions (Cleanup)

- Both candidate commits (98cda871 claude-dispatch-ux, 4bbb9273 intent-workflows) evaluated and dismissed -- useful code already exists on main in different forms. No preserve branches created per user decision.
- Interactive confirmation required before deleting worktrees/branches -- show full list, pause for explicit user approval.
- Manual review for all 13 unresolved blocker flags -- user decides keep/archive/resolve per flag.
- Auto-archive by age is NOT used.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 34 added: Cleanup — Address stale worktrees, orphaned branches, and stale blocker flags from prior colony work.

### Phase 35 Decisions (Platform Parity)

- Drift detection test is hard-failing to force explicit decisions about intentional divergence.
- Codex completeness test is advisory (logs warnings) because platform-specific adaptations are legitimate.
- All 25 OpenCode agents drift from Claude masters (16-316 lines each); Plan 02 will fix.
- 53 Codex warnings logged (21 deprecated patterns, 32 missing content); Plan 03 will address.

### Phase 40 Decisions (Stable Publish Hardening)

- Hub follows binary: publish updates hub version.json to match binary version.
- Publish fails loudly if binary and hub versions cannot be synchronized.
- aether publish replaces ad-hoc install --package-dir pattern; backward compatibility preserved.
- aether version --check provides manual downstream verification.

## Phase 41 Decisions (Dev-Channel Isolation)

- validateChannelIsolation uses filepath.Abs + strings.Contains for normalized path matching.
- Cross-channel publish operations are rejected with actionable error messages guiding the user to the correct channel flag.
- warnBinaryCoLocation is purely informational and does not block publish (co-location may be intentional).
- Rapid back-to-back publish tests use --skip-build-binary to avoid go build overhead and flaky build failures.

## Phase 43 Decisions (Release Integrity Checks)

- scanIntegrity focuses on VERSION CHAIN only (binary vs hub agreement, stale publish detection); scanHubPublishIntegrity handles FILE COUNT parity separately to avoid duplicate issues.
- Replaced os.Exit(2) with error return in integrity_cmd.go hub-not-installed path for testability, consistent with RunE pattern used by all other commands.
- 14 tests cover scanIntegrity unit behavior, integrity command E2E, and medic deep integration.

### Blockers / Concerns

- 6 unreleased fix commits need v1.0.20.
- Content parity test currently fails CI until Plan 02 fixes the drift.
