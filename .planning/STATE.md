# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

**Core value:** Colony learning loops produce visible output -- decisions, instincts, midden entries, and auto-pheromones accumulate naturally during build/continue cycles.
**Current focus:** Phase 13 -- Midden Write Path Expansion

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.2 Integration Gaps
Phase: 13 of 14 (Midden Write Path Expansion)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-14 -- Completed 13-01 (midden-write path expansion)

Progress: [█████████░] 50%

- Average duration: 3.7min
- Total execution time: 0.74 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2 roadmap]: Skipped test-first phase -- research recommended Phase 1 for verification infrastructure, but user opted to fold runtime verification into each phase's success criteria instead
- [v1.2 roadmap]: 3 phases not 5 -- MID-03 (intra-phase threshold) folded into Phase 13 with MID-01/MID-02; MEM-02 (rolling-summary) folded into Phase 12 with MEM-01
- [v1.2 roadmap]: Phases 13 and 14 parallelizable -- they edit different playbook files (build-wave/continue-verify vs continue-advance) with no shared call sites
- [12-01]: Success capture placed after spawn-complete, before Step 5.8 -- preserves existing flow
- [12-01]: Pattern synthesis cap set at 2 per build to prevent observation inflation
- [12-02]: Accept minor duplication with context-capsule's rolling-summary entries -- dedicated section guarantees visibility
- [12-02]: Read entries directly from rolling-summary.log with tail/awk, not via context-capsule subcommand
- [13-01]: midden-write inserted AFTER heredoc and BEFORE memory-capture to preserve existing flow
- [13-01]: Category names standardized: worker_failure, resilience, verification, abandoned-approach

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
