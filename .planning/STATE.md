# Project State

## Project Reference

See: [.planning/PROJECT.md](/Users/callumcowie-repos-Aether/.planning/PROJECT.md:1)

**Core value:** Aether should feel alive and truthful at runtime, not only look clever in wrappers or tests.
**Current focus:** Phase --phase — 34

## Current Position

Phase: 34 (34-cleanup) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3 (34-cleanup)
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-23

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Total commits: 16
- All tests green (2900+ passing)

**By Plan:**

| Plan | Wave | Commits | Requirements | Key Outcome |
|------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 01 Worker Truth | 1 | 3 | R045, R046 | FakeInvoker blocked, DispatchBatch errors surface |
| 02 Continue Truth | 2 | 4 | R047, R048 | 4 bypass paths closed |
| 04 Git Claims | 3 | 3 | R049, R050 | Claims verified against git, no environmental dismissal |
| 03 Atomic State | 4 | 6 | R051 | UpdateJSONAtomically, state saved before side effects |
| Phase 34 P01 | 5min | 2 tasks | 0 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.3 shipped with all 12 requirements satisfied (R027-R038).
- v1.4 was marked complete but found to be synthetic — runtime did not match claims. Completion retracted.
- v1.5 is a truth-recovery milestone, not feature expansion.
- Oracle audit (33 issues: 7 P0, 6 P1, 8 P2, 9 P3, 3 P4) is authoritative for scope.
- Active colony stuck in phase 2 with continue orchestration blocked.
- 6 phases defined for v1.5: 31 (P0 Truth), 32 (Continue Unblock), 33 (Dispatch Fixes), 34 (Cleanup), 35 (Parity), 36 (Release Decision).
- In-repo build claims are git-verified for ALL completed workers (R049 resolved).
- Environmental dismissal removed from verification — all failures produce honest summaries (R050 resolved).
- Integration tests prove bypass paths stay closed for verified_partial, watcher timeout, reconcile, and git claims.
- FakeInvoker blocked from production paths; real invoker requires honest platform dispatch.
- DispatchBatch error propagation ensures dispatch errors surface to callers.
- Colony state advancement is atomic via UpdateJSONAtomically; state saved before side effects and reports (R051 resolved).
- Side-effect failures after state commit do not roll back; state remains valid and consistent.
- Continue detects abandoned builds (all dispatches stuck at "spawned" >10 min) and returns blocked=true with recovery commands.
- Stale report files (verification.json, gates.json, continue.json, review.json) are cleared before continue verification runs.
- Full E2E recovery pipeline proven: abandoned detection -> re-dispatch -> verify -> advance.
- Both candidate commits (98cda871 claude-dispatch-ux, 4bbb9273 intent-workflows) evaluated and dismissed -- useful code already exists on main, no preserve branches needed

### Phase 34 Decisions (Cleanup)

- Both candidate commits (98cda871 claude-dispatch-ux, 4bbb9273 intent-workflows) evaluated and dismissed -- useful code already exists on main in different forms. No preserve branches created per user decision.
- Interactive confirmation required before deleting worktrees/branches -- show full list, pause for explicit user approval.
- Manual review for all 13 unresolved blocker flags -- user decides keep/archive/resolve per flag.
- Auto-archive by age is NOT used.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 34 added: Cleanup — Address stale worktrees, orphaned branches, and stale blocker flags from prior colony work.

### Blockers / Concerns

- 464 stale worktrees (~43+ GB) distort the system (R056).
- 459 stale test-audit branches (R057).
- 13 unresolved blocker flags (R058).
- 6 unreleased fix commits need v1.0.20.
