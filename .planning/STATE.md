# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** The pheromone system should be a living system -- auto-emitting signals during builds, carrying context across sessions, and actually changing worker behavior -- not just a storage format that nobody reads.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Data Purge

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Data Purge)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-03-19 -- Completed 01-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 12%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-data-purge | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min
- Trend: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Clean before integrating -- test data must be purged before pheromone integration can be validated
- [Roadmap]: XML exchange system should be ACTIVATED (wired into commands), not archived
- [Roadmap]: constraints.json is a legacy parallel store; eventual deprecation in favor of pheromones.json
- [01-02]: Force-added gitignored data files to commit purge changes for traceability
- [01-02]: Kept all 16 real worker spawn records in spawn-tree.txt
- [Phase 01]: Kept sig_feedback_001 despite 'Test coverage' text matching broad regex -- it is a real signal from worker_builder, not test data
- [Phase 01]: pheromones.json and constraints.json are gitignored -- cleaned locally but not committable to git

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 3 (Pheromone Signal Plumbing) likely needs research-phase during planning due to multiple interacting components across bash, playbooks, and agent definitions
- Risk: aether-utils.sh has 150 subcommands with no module boundaries; schema changes can cascade across 47+ test files
