## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v5.5]: Binary installs to hub-scoped `~/.aether/bin/aether` to avoid PATH collision with npm shim
- [v5.5]: Non-blocking binary download -- failures never block install/update
- [v5.5]: Two-phase rollout -- binary first (Phase 49), YAML wiring only after version gate passes (Phase 51)
- [Phase 48]: goreleaser-action@v6 chosen over v7 for release workflow (more stable)
- [Phase 48]: install-only + goreleaser check in CI catches config drift before release

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
