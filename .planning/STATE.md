# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Workers automatically receive all relevant context -- the colony improves itself.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Instinct Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Instinct Pipeline)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (PHASE COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 1 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-06 -- Completed 01-03 (instinct pipeline integration tests)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-instinct-pipeline | 3 | 6min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (1min), 01-02 (2min), 01-03 (3min)
- Trend: starting

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 vertical pipeline phases, each delivering complete data flow from capture to injection
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 starts with instinct pipeline (write instincts in continue, read in colony-prime)
- [01-01]: Confidence floor raised from 0.4 to 0.7 -- only validated patterns become instincts
- [01-01]: Error patterns get 0.8 confidence (higher than success 0.7) as stronger signals
- [01-01]: Success instincts capped at 2 per phase to prevent noise
- [01-02]: Same domain-grouped format for compact and non-compact modes
- [01-02]: No changes needed to build-context.md or build-wave.md -- existing pipeline chain works
- [01-03]: IEEE 754 floating point requires approximate comparison for confidence boost assertions

### Pending Todos
