# Project State

## Project Reference

See: [.planning/PROJECT.md](/Users/callumcowie-repos-Aether/.planning/PROJECT.md:1)

**Core value:** Aether should feel alive and truthful at runtime, not only look clever in wrappers or tests.
**Current focus:** Phase 31 complete — ready for Phase 32 (Continue Unblock)

## Current Position

Phase: 31 of 36 (P0 Runtime Truth Fixes) — COMPLETE
Status: All 4 plans executed, all 12 validation tests green
Last activity: 2026-04-22 -- Phase 31 verified and closed

Progress: `[██████████] 100%` (Phase 31)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Total commits: 16
- All tests green (2900+ passing)

**By Plan:**

| Plan | Wave | Commits | Requirements | Key Outcome |
|------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 01 Worker Truth | 1 | 3 | R045, R046 | FakeInvoker blocked, DispatchBatch errors surface |
| 02 Continue Truth | 2 | 4 | R047, R048 | 4 bypass paths closed |
| 04 Git Claims | 3 | 3 | R049, R050 | Claims verified against git, no environmental dismissal |
| 03 Atomic State | 4 | 6 | R051 | UpdateJSONAtomically, state saved before side effects |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.3 shipped with all 12 requirements satisfied (R027-R038).
- v1.4 was marked complete but found to be synthetic — runtime did not match claims. Completion retracted.
- v1.5 is a truth-recovery milestone, not feature expansion.
- Oracle audit (33 issues: 7 P0, 6 P1, 8 P2, 9 P3, 3 P4) is authoritative for scope.
- Active colony stuck in phase 2 with continue orchestration blocked.
- 6 phases defined for v1.5: 31 (P0 Truth), 32 (Continue Unblock), 33 (Dispatch Fixes), 34 (Cleanup), 35 (Parity), 36 (Release Decision).
- In-repo build claims are git-verified for ALL completed workers (R049 resolved).
- Environmental dismissal removed from verification — all failures produce honest summaries (R050 resolved).
- Integration tests prove bypass paths stay closed for verified_partial, watcher timeout, reconcile, and git claims.
- FakeInvoker blocked from production paths; real invoker requires honest platform dispatch.
- DispatchBatch error propagation ensures dispatch errors surface to callers.
- Colony state advancement is atomic via UpdateJSONAtomically; state saved before side effects and reports (R051 resolved).
- Side-effect failures after state commit do not roll back; state remains valid and consistent.

### Blockers / Concerns

- 464 stale worktrees (~43+ GB) distort the system (R056).
- 459 stale test-audit branches (R057).
- 13 unresolved blocker flags (R058).
- 6 unreleased fix commits need v1.0.20.
