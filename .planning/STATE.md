# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 48 — graph-layer

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 42.1 inserted after Phase 42: Release hygiene — version drift, npm packaging, OpenCode agent parity, exchange distribution, doc accuracy, test coverage (URGENT)

### Decisions

**From 36-01:**

- Generated files include header comment marking them as generated artifacts
- body_claude/body_opencode skip template processing since content is already provider-specific

**From 34-04:**

- Standalone scripts (swarm-display.sh, watch-spawn-tree.sh) resolve COLONY_DATA_DIR inline since they are not sourced by aether-utils.sh
- error-handler.sh safely uses COLONY_DATA_DIR since it is sourced after COLONY_DATA_DIR initialization
- state-api.sh and state-loader.sh unchanged -- they only reference COLONY_STATE.json at DATA_DIR

**From 34-03:**

- COLONY_STATE.json remains at DATA_DIR root as the colony identification anchor
- Per-colony files use COLONY_DATA_DIR, shared files use DATA_DIR
- Migration uses presence-based detection (no version field)
- Migration function intentionally uses DATA_DIR for source paths

**From Phase 33:**

- Use `jq -n --arg` for strings and `--argjson` for numbers/booleans in json_ok construction
- Drop `^` and `$` regex anchors when switching to `grep -F` since fixed-string mode treats them as literals
- Ant names are unique per swarm, so `grep -F` without anchors is safe for timing file lookups
- Trap-based lock cleanup is the standard pattern; explicit release_lock kept as defense-in-depth
- Safety stats are best-effort and never fail the calling operation
- Safety stats stored in .aether/data/safety-stats.json (local-only)
- data-safety-stats subcommand returns zero defaults when no stats file exists
- Integration tests use temp directory isolation with AETHER_ROOT override
- [Phase 34]: Colony isolation integration tests verify COLONY_DATA_DIR resolution, auto-migration, lock tagging, name sanitization, and backward compatibility
- [Phase 35]: Used DEPTH CHECK guard clause pattern at top of each gated spawn step for consistency
- [Phase 35]: Inserted depth display as Step 2.5.5 in status.md to avoid renumbering existing non-sequential steps
- [Phase 35]: Depth read uses graceful fallback to standard when colony-depth get fails
- [Phase 36]: Used body_claude/body_opencode for 16 of 22 complex commands where provider bodies are structurally different
- [Phase 36]: Used standard body with provider-exclusive blocks for focus, redirect, feedback, status, init, flag (6 commands with mixed shared/exclusive content)

- [37-02] Import step placed after colony creation so data files exist as targets
- [37-02] xmllint required before offering import (hard dependency of pheromone-import-xml)
- [37-02] All three data types imported together, no cherry-picking (per D-09)
- [Phase 37]: Check 7 in validate-package.sh validates exchange shell scripts (.sh), not XML data files
- [Phase 38]: Pre-existing instinct-confidence test failures (4 tests) deferred as unrelated to spawn-tree.sh changes
- [Phase 38]: error-codes.md descriptions verified accurate; only last-updated date needed changing
- [Phase 41]: Step 2.0.6 added to both continue-verify.md and continue-advance.md since plan specified both as targets
- [Phase 41]: All midden wiring is non-blocking following the pheromone merge-back pattern from Step 2.0.5
- [Phase 42.1]: Added 23 missing entries to REQUIRED_FILES in one batch (20 shell + 3 non-shell)
- [Phase 42.1]: Used generate-commands.js for bulk regeneration rather than manual editing
- [42.1-02]: CLAUDE.md version tracks development milestone (v2.7-dev), not npm semver
- [42.1-02]: Fixed 4 additional stale references in Architecture Overview and Key Directories beyond plan's explicit list to meet acceptance criteria
- [Phase 43]: Dispatcher wiring pattern: source line, dispatch case, help JSON entry -- three-part registration
- [Phase 43]: Research predicted 5/12 worktree test failures but dispatcher wiring resolved all 12
- [Phase 44]: Used ~5,500 for aether-utils.sh line count (actual 5,469) for rounding stability
- [Phase 44]: CHANGELOG uses npm version [5.3.0] as section header per keepachangelog convention
- [45-02]: Used crypto/rand hex suffix for temp file naming instead of PID-only for concurrent safety
- [45-02]: Used fmt.Fprintf to stderr for malformed JSONL logging instead of log.Printf
- [45-02]: Created full Store type in storage.go since the file did not exist despite plan referencing it

### Pending Todos

- Add Data Safety display step to .claude/commands/ant/status.md (requires command file edit permission)

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.
