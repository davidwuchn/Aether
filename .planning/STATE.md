# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-30)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 39 — state-safety

## Current Position

Phase: 39 (state-safety) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-30

Progress: ████████████████████ 100% (v1.3 through v2.6 shipped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

**From v2.6:**

- Use `jq -n --arg` for strings and `--argjson` for numbers/booleans in json_ok construction
- Drop `^` and `$` regex anchors when switching to `grep -F`
- Colony isolation via COLONY_DATA_DIR, per-colony file namespacing
- YAML command generator for dual-provider output (Claude + OpenCode)
- XML lifecycle integration in seal, entomb, init

**From state corruption fix (this session):**

- ALL COLONY_STATE.json writes must use `state-mutate` (never full-file reconstruction)
- `state-mutate` now forwards --arg/--argjson/--slurpfile/--rawfile flags to jq
- Git stash push is safe for COLONY_STATE.json because .aether/data/ is gitignored
- The animation repo corruption was caused by Colony A's state being committed to git + git stash push reverting to committed version
- Published npm package must NOT include dev/WIP artifacts

**From PR workflow research:**

- Task-as-PR is the correct granularity (1-50 lines, 76-80% success rate)
- Instruction quality > model quality for PR success
- 5-tier review pipeline: CI Checks → Agent Reviews → Aggregation → Human Gate → Post-Merge
- Sequential merge within waves, parallel PRs per wave
- Branch-local state (pheromones, midden, COLONY_STATE.json) needs hub-level coordination
- Auto-fix convergence works for single-branch CI failures; cross-branch conflicts need prevention
- [Phase 40]: Export file moved to .aether/exchange/ instead of gitignore exception for .aether/data/ -- cleaner, exchange/ is already tracked
- [Phase 40]: Pheromone export in seal only runs on non-main branches, non-blocking

### Pending Todos

- Plan and execute Phase 39: State Safety (state-mutate migration + test fixes)
- Implement Phase 40: Pheromone Propagation (3 subcommands from design doc)
- Implement Phase 41: Midden Collection (3 subcommands from design doc)
- Implement Phase 42: CI Context Assembly (pr-context subcommand)
- Wire Phase 43: Clash Detection Integration (hook + worktree + merge driver)
- Phase 44: Release Hygiene & Ship v2.7.0

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.
