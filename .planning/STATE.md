# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 35 -- colony-depth-model-routing

## Current Position

Phase: 35 (colony-depth-model-routing) -- EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Executing Phase 35
Last activity: 2026-03-29 -- Phase 35 Plan 01 complete

Progress: [████████░░] 83% (34-01 through 34-05, 35-01 complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

**From 35-01:**

- Used jq .ok|tostring instead of .ok// for boolean false parsing in tests (jq alternative operator treats false as falsy)

**From 34-04:**

- Standalone scripts (swarm-display.sh, watch-spawn-tree.sh) resolve COLONY_DATA_DIR inline since they are not sourced by aether-utils.sh
- error-handler.sh safely uses COLONY_DATA_DIR since it is sourced after COLONY_DATA_DIR initialization
- state-api.sh and state-loader.sh unchanged -- they only reference COLONY_STATE.json at DATA_DIR

**From 34-03:**

- COLONY_STATE.json remains at DATA_DIR root as the colony identification anchor
- Per-colony files use COLONY_DATA_DIR, shared files use DATA_DIR
- Migration uses presence-based detection (no version field)
- Migration function intentionally uses DATA_DIR for source paths

**From Phase 33:**

- Use `jq -n --arg` for strings and `--argjson` for numbers/booleans in json_ok construction
- Drop `^` and `$` regex anchors when switching to `grep -F` since fixed-string mode treats them as literals
- Integration tests use temp directory isolation with AETHER_ROOT override

### Pending Todos

- Add Data Safety display step to .claude/commands/ant/status.md (requires command file edit permission)

### Blockers/Concerns
