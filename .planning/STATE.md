# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 34 — cross-colony-isolation

## Current Position

Phase: 34 (cross-colony-isolation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 34
Last activity: 2026-03-29 -- Phase 34 execution started

Progress: [##........] 16% (v2.6: 4/24 plans estimated)

- Total plans completed: 86 (82 from v2.1-v2.5 + 4 from v2.6)
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: ~7 hours

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 33-01 | grep-F + json_ok escaping | 23min | 2 | 4 |
| 33-02 | json_ok escaping + sanitize-on-read | 35min | 3 | 13 |
| 33-03 | lock safety + atomic write hardening | 27min | 2 | 3 |
| 33-04 | data safety tests + status display | 11min | 2 | 2 |

*Updated after 33-04 completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Use `jq -n --arg` for strings and `--argjson` for numbers/booleans in json_ok construction
- Drop `^` and `$` regex anchors when switching to `grep -F` since fixed-string mode treats them as literals
- Ant names are unique per swarm, so `grep -F` without anchors is safe for timing file lookups
- Trap-based lock cleanup is the standard pattern; explicit release_lock kept as defense-in-depth
- Safety stats are best-effort and never fail the calling operation
- Safety stats stored in .aether/data/safety-stats.json (local-only)
- data-safety-stats subcommand returns zero defaults when no stats file exists
- Integration tests use temp directory isolation with AETHER_ROOT override

### Pending Todos

- Add Data Safety display step to .claude/commands/ant/status.md (requires command file edit permission)

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.
