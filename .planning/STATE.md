# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 34 — Cross-Colony Isolation

## Current Position

Phase: 34 (cross-colony-isolation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 5 (34-03 complete, 34-04 + 34-05 remaining)
Status: Executing Phase 34, Wave 3
Last activity: 2026-03-29 -- continuing with waves 3+4

Progress: [█████░░░] 60% (34-01, 34-02, 34-03 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v2.1-v2.5):**

- Total plans completed: 86 (82 from v2.1-v2.5 + 4 from v2.6)
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: ~7 hours

**Milestone History:**

- v1.3: 8 phases (1-8), 17 plans — shipped 2026-03-19
- v2.1: 8 phases (9-16), 39 plans — shipped 2026-03-24
- v2.2: 4 phases (17-20), 5 plans — shipped 2026-03-25

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

**From 34-03:**
- COLONY_STATE.json remains at DATA_DIR root as the colony identification anchor
- Per-colony files use COLONY_DATA_DIR, shared files use DATA_DIR
- Migration uses presence-based detection (no version field)
- Migration function intentionally uses DATA_DIR for source paths

**From Phase 33:**
- Use `jq -n --arg` for strings and `--argjson` for numbers/booleans in json_ok construction
- Drop `^` and `$` regex anchors when switching to `grep -F` since fixed-string mode treats them as literals
- Ant names are unique per swarm, so `grep -F` without anchors is safe for timing file lookups
- Trap-based lock cleanup is the standard pattern; explicit release_lock kept as defense-in-depth
- Safety stats are best-effort and never fail the calling operation
- Safety stats stored in .aether/data/safety-stats.json (local-only)
- data-safety-stats subcommand returns zero defaults when no stats file exists
- Integration tests use temp directory isolation with AETHER_ROOT override

### Pending Todos

- Add Data Safety display step to .claude/commands/ant/status.md (requires command file edit permission)

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.
