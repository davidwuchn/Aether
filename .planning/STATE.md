# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 — Dead Code Deprecation (v2.1 Production Hardening)

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 16 (Dead Code Deprecation) -- NOT STARTED
Plan: 0 of TBD
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-24 — Completed Phase 10 (Error Triage) — all 3 plans done

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 17
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 1.20 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-data-purge | 1 | 3min | 3min |
| 02-command-audit-data-tooling | 2 | 12min | 6min |
| 03-pheromone-signal-plumbing | 2 | 8min | 4min |
| 04-pheromone-worker-integration | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 05-learning-pipeline-validation | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 06-xml-exchange-activation | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |
| 07-fresh-install-hardening | 2 | 7min | 3.5min |
| 08-documentation-update | 2 | 6min | 3min |
| 09-quick-wins | 2 | 10min | 5min |
| 10-error-triage | 2 | 28min | 14min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min, 5min, 5min, 12min, 16min
- Trend: increasing (large file-wide refactoring tasks)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap v2.1]: Quick wins first (6 independent fixes) to establish green baseline before structural work
- [Roadmap v2.1]: Error triage before modularization to prevent refactoring death spiral
- [Roadmap v2.1]: State API facade (QUAL-04) before domain extraction (QUAL-05/06/07) — dependency order is non-negotiable
- [Roadmap v2.1]: Documentation last — every prior code change makes earlier doc corrections stale
- [Roadmap v2.1]: Dead code deprecation (warnings) before removal — one-cycle confirmation across all 3 surfaces
- [09-01]: Learning-observations uses .bak.N naming (not create_backup) for recovery compatibility
- [09-01]: state-checkpoint uses create_backup (timestamped naming) matching existing atomic-write patterns
- [09-01]: All backups corrupted = hard stop (not auto-reset) per user decision
- [09-02]: state-write uses E_UNKNOWN (not E_INTERNAL) because E_INTERNAL is undefined
- [09-02]: Trimming markers use [trimmed]/[!trimmed] distinct from recovery warning markers
- [10-01]: [error] prefix for _aether_log_error -- distinct from json_err (JSON), recovery (⚠), budget ([trimmed])
- [10-01]: SUPPRESS:OK categories: cleanup, read-default, existence-test, cross-platform, idempotent, validation
- [10-01]: 60 type/command-v idioms left uncommented (universally understood)
- [10-01]: 35 lazy/dangerous patterns deferred to Plans 02/03
- [10-02]: Actual lazy count was ~25 (not ~110) -- Plan 01 was more thorough than research estimated
- [10-02]: grep -c on variables is SUPPRESS:OK (grep exit-code handling, not lazy suppression)
- [10-02]: acquire_lock on registry deferred to Plan 03 (dangerous write-path suppression)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 14 (Planning Depth) needs a design spike on how to distinguish phases needing research from phases that do not
- Risk: ~10 dangerous suppressions remain for Plan 03 (create_backup, acquire_lock, direct state writes, jq transforms)
- Pre-existing: 1 test failure in context-continuity (addressed in Phase 12 via QUAL-09)

## Session Continuity
