# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Workers automatically receive all relevant context -- the colony improves itself.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Learnings Injection (COMPLETE)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Learnings Injection)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-06 -- Completed 02-02 (learnings injection integration tests)

Progress: [██████░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 0.18 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-instinct-pipeline | 3 | 6min | 2min |
| 02-learnings-injection | 2 | 5min | 2.5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (2min), 01-03 (3min), 02-01 (3min), 02-02 (2min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 vertical pipeline phases, each delivering complete data flow from capture to injection
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 starts with instinct pipeline (write instincts in continue, read in colony-prime)
- [01-01]: Confidence floor raised from 0.4 to 0.7 -- only validated patterns become instincts
- [01-01]: Error patterns get 0.8 confidence (higher than success 0.7) as stronger signals
- [01-01]: Success instincts capped at 2 per phase to prevent noise
- [01-02]: Same domain-grouped format for compact and non-compact modes
- [01-02]: No changes needed to build-context.md or build-wave.md -- existing pipeline chain works
- [01-03]: IEEE 754 floating point requires approximate comparison for confidence boost assertions
- [02-01]: Learnings placed between context-capsule and pheromone signals in prompt assembly order
- [02-01]: Inherited learnings sorted first (before numeric phases) for foundational visibility
- [02-01]: Compact mode: 5 claims max; non-compact: 15 claims max
- [02-02]: Extended setupTestColony helper with phaseLearnings and currentPhase rather than shared module
