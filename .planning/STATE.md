# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 34 — Cross-Colony Isolation

## Current Position

Phase: 35
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-03-29

Progress: [██████░░] 80% (34-01, 34-02, 34-03, 34-04 complete)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

**From 34-04:**

- Standalone scripts (swarm-display.sh, watch-spawn-tree.sh) resolve COLONY_DATA_DIR inline since they are not sourced by aether-utils.sh
- error-handler.sh safely uses COLONY_DATA_DIR since it is sourced after COLONY_DATA_DIR initialization
- state-api.sh and state-loader.sh unchanged -- they only reference COLONY_STATE.json at DATA_DIR

**From 34-03:**

- COLONY_STATE.json remains at DATA_DIR root as the colony identification anchor
- Per-colony files use COLONY_DATA_DIR, shared files use DATA_DIR
- Migration uses presence-based detection (no version field)
- Migration function intentionally uses DATA_DIR for source paths

**From Phase 33:**

- Use `jq -n --arg` for strings and `--argjson` for numbers/booleans in json_ok construction
- Drop `^` and `$` regex anchors when switching to `grep -F` since fixed-string mode treats them as literals
- Ant names are unique per swarm, so `grep -F` without anchors is safe for timing file lookups
- Trap-based lock cleanup is the standard pattern; explicit release_lock kept as defense-in-depth
- Safety stats are best-effort and never fail the calling operation
- Safety stats stored in .aether/data/safety-stats.json (local-only)
- data-safety-stats subcommand returns zero defaults when no stats file exists
- Integration tests use temp directory isolation with AETHER_ROOT override
- [Phase 34]: Colony isolation integration tests verify COLONY_DATA_DIR resolution, auto-migration, lock tagging, name sanitization, and backward compatibility
- [Phase 35]: Used DEPTH CHECK guard clause pattern at top of each gated spawn step for consistency
- [Phase 35]: Inserted depth display as Step 2.5.5 in status.md to avoid renumbering existing non-sequential steps
- [Phase 35]: Depth read uses graceful fallback to standard when colony-depth get fails

### Pending Todos

- Add Data Safety display step to .claude/commands/ant/status.md (requires command file edit permission)

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.
