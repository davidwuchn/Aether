# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

**Core value:** Reliably interpret user requests, decompose into work, verify outputs, and ship correct work with minimal back-and-forth.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — integration-parity-tests

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (integration-parity-tests) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 10
Last activity: 2026-04-04

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Go binary has 193+ commands implemented out of ~305 shell subcommands
- Phases 05 and 06 complete -- structural learning, XML exchange, display, and suggestion commands ported
- 20 critical shell commands still missing (needed by slash commands)
- Phase 07 targets remaining shell-only commands
- [Phase 07]: Used local rand.Rand per invocation for deterministic --seed flag support (DIFF-01)
- [Phase 07]: Midden-write uses flat midden.json path matching existing Go midden commands
- [Phase 07]: check-antipattern returns clean:true for nonexistent files for shell compatibility
- [Phase 07]: signature-match validates regex and returns error envelope for invalid patterns
- [Phase 07]: [Phase 07 P03]: Alias commands share RunE helpers with nested exchange commands (zero duplication)
- [Phase 07]: [Phase 07 P03]: context-update writes to rolling-summary.log pipe-delimited format, matching extractRollingSummary reader
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 07 P04]: swarm-display-text already existed, 20 new commands instead of 21
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 07 P04]: spawn-get-depth uses pipe-delimited format matching SpawnTree.Parse
- [Phase 08]: normalize-args uses outputOK JSON envelope; YAML generator extracts with jq -r .result
- [Phase 08]: JSON output flag pattern: check bool flag before table render, use outputOK envelope with typed nil-slices for empty arrays
- [Phase 08]: [Phase 08 P02]: Used Python conversion script for systematic batch replacement of 345 shell invocations across 45 YAML files
- [Phase 08]: [Phase 08 P02]: Parallel execution with 08-01 overlapped on 8 high-count files; verified identical results
- [Phase 08]: Verification-only plan confirmed all 90 generated files already match YAML sources from 08-02; no file changes needed
- [Phase 08]: [Phase 08 P03]: Verification-only plan confirmed all 90 generated files already match YAML sources from 08-02; no file changes needed
- [Phase 09]: Used Python conversion script for systematic batch replacement of 220 shell calls across 5 playbook files
- [Phase 09]: [Phase 09 P02]: Reused Python regex substitution from Plan 01; 73 shell calls replaced (more than estimated 67)
- [Phase 10]: File-based shell output capture prevents pipe goroutine hangs in parity tests
- [Phase 10]: Known parity breaks documented as test metadata, not suppressed

### Blockers/Concerns

- 1 failing test in pkg/colony (TestRoundTripRealColonyState)
