### v2.3 Per-Caste Model Routing (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Reasoning-heavy castes use GLM-5 via the opus slot while execution castes stay on GLM-5-turbo via sonnet, using model-profiles.yaml as the single source of truth.

- [x] **Phase 21: Test Infrastructure Refactor** - Centralize test mocks to read from model-profiles.yaml so tests survive YAML changes (completed 2026-03-27)
- [x] **Phase 22: Config Foundation & Core Routing** - Map castes to model slots via agent frontmatter, update settings and YAML config (completed 2026-03-27)
- [x] **Phase 23: Tooling & Overrides** - Slot resolution functions, CLI subcommand, and build-time model override flag (completed 2026-03-27)
- [ ] **Phase 24: Safety & Verification** - Spawn-tree tracking, verify-castes display, GLM-5 loop warnings, config swap docs

## Phase Details

### Phase 21: Test Infrastructure Refactor
**Goal**: Tests read caste-to-model mappings from model-profiles.yaml instead of hardcoding model names, so any future YAML change does not break the test suite
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v2.3)
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Changing a caste's model assignment in model-profiles.yaml causes all related test assertions to update automatically (no manual test edits needed)
  2. A new test can import the mock profile helper and get the full caste-to-model mapping without duplicating any YAML content
  3. Running the full test suite after swapping two castes' model assignments in YAML produces zero failures
**Plans**: 3 plans (2 completed + 1 gap closure)
  - [x] 21-01-PLAN.md — Create centralized mock profile helper and refactor 3 core test files
  - [x] 21-02-PLAN.md — Refactor CLI/telemetry test files and add regression test
  - [ ] 21-03-PLAN.md — Gap closure: replace hardcoded model names in integration test

### Phase 22: Config Foundation & Core Routing
**Goal**: Reasoning castes route to the opus model slot and execution castes route to the sonnet slot, with a single settings.json change activating the GLM-5 mapping chain
**Depends on**: Phase 21 (test infrastructure must be centralized before YAML changes)
**Requirements**: ROUTE-01, ROUTE-02, ROUTE-03, ROUTE-04, ROUTE-05, ROUTE-06, ROUTE-07, ROUTE-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. 8 opus castes (queen, archaeologist, route-setter, sage, tracker, auditor, gatekeeper, measurer) declare `model: opus` in frontmatter
  2. 11 sonnet castes declare `model: sonnet` in frontmatter; 3 inherit castes remain `model: inherit`
  3. `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` in settings.json points to `glm-5`, making opus-slot agents use GLM-5 through the proxy
  4. model-profiles.yaml reflects the two-tier split with slot names; workers.md documents dual-mode switching
**Plans**: 3 plans
  - [ ] 22-01-PLAN.md -- Fix REQUIREMENTS.md, restructure YAML with slot names, deprecate spawn-with-model.sh
  - [ ] 22-02-PLAN.md -- Update agent frontmatter model: fields (44 files) and sync mirrors
  - [ ] 22-03-PLAN.md -- Rewrite workers.md and verify-castes.md documentation

### Phase 23: Tooling & Overrides
**Goal**: Aether provides functions and CLI commands to resolve any caste to its model slot, and builders can override the default slot for an entire build
**Depends on**: Phase 22 (routing must be established before tooling queries it)
**Requirements**: TOOL-01, TOOL-02, TOOL-03, TOOL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `model-slot get builder` outputs `sonnet`; running `model-slot get queen` outputs `opus`
  2. The `getModelSlotForCaste()` function in bin/lib/model-profiles.js returns the correct slot for all 22 castes when reading from model-profiles.yaml
  3. Passing `--model opus` to `/ant:build <phase>` forces all workers in that build to use the opus slot regardless of their default assignment
  4. Invalid slot names (e.g., `--model gpt-4`) produce a clear error listing the valid options (opus, sonnet, haiku, inherit)
**Plans**: 2 plans
  - [ ] 23-01-PLAN.md — Add getModelSlotForCaste and validateSlot to model-profiles.js (TDD)
  - [ ] 23-02-PLAN.md — Add model-slot CLI subcommand and update build override validation

### Phase 24: Safety & Verification
**Goal**: Users can verify which model slot each caste uses at runtime, spawned workers show their slot in the spawn tree, and GLM-5 loop risk is documented in reasoning caste agent definitions
**Depends on**: Phase 22 (castes must have slot assignments to display), Phase 23 (slot resolution must work for verify-castes)
**Requirements**: SAFE-01, SAFE-02, SAFE-03, SAFE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. spawn-tree.txt includes a `model` column showing the slot (opus/sonnet/inherit) used for each spawned worker
  2. `/ant:verify-castes` prints a table mapping every caste to its assigned model slot, with reasoning castes visually distinguished from execution castes
  3. The queen, archaeologist, and route-setter agent definitions contain a safety note warning about GLM-5 loop risk when generation constraints are not enforced
  4. A user reading workers.md or verify-castes.md can follow step-by-step instructions to swap between Claude API and GLM proxy modes
**Plans**: 2 plans
  - [ ] 24-01-PLAN.md — Auto-resolve model slot in spawn-tree entries and add GLM-5 loop warnings to opus-caste agents
  - [ ] 24-02-PLAN.md — Reformat verify-castes to 3-column table and consolidate config swap docs
