### v2.6 Bugfix & Hardening (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Fix critical data-corruption bugs, harden infrastructure, clear high-priority TODOs.

- [x] **Phase 33: Input Escaping & Atomic Write Safety** - Fix ant_name injection in grep/JSON, jq-escape all dynamic values, release locks on validation failure (completed 2026-03-29)
- [x] **Phase 34: Cross-Colony Isolation** - Eliminate information bleed between colonies via proper name extraction, lock scoping, and file namespacing (completed 2026-03-29)
- [ ] **Phase 35: Colony Depth & Model Routing** - Depth selector gates Oracle/Scout spawns; model routing either wired end-to-end or dead code removed
- [ ] **Phase 36: YAML Command Generator** - Single YAML source produces both Claude and OpenCode command markdown
- [ ] **Phase 37: XML Core Integration** - XML export/import wired into seal, entomb, and init lifecycle commands
- [ ] **Phase 38: Cleanup & Maintenance** - Deprecate old npm versions, generate error code docs, remove dead awk code

## Phase Details

### Phase 33: Input Escaping & Atomic Write Safety
**Goal**: Dynamic values flowing through grep patterns, JSON construction, and atomic writes cannot corrupt data or break commands
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase — fixes data-corrupting bugs)
**Requirements**: SAFE-01, SAFE-03, SAFE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `grep -F` on ant_name values containing regex metacharacters (e.g., `worker.builder+1`) returns correct matches without errors across spawn.sh, swarm.sh, spawn-tree.sh, aether-utils.sh
  2. JSON output from all 14 identified locations in utils/ produces valid JSON even when dynamic values contain quotes, newlines, or backslashes
  3. When atomic_write encounters a JSON validation failure, the lock file is released and no stale locks remain
  4. All 616+ existing tests still pass after escaping changes
**Plans**: 4 plans
- [ ] 33-01-PLAN.md — Fix grep pattern injection: add -F flag to all ant_name greps + escape ant_name in JSON output
- [ ] 33-02-PLAN.md — Fix json_ok string interpolation across all utils/ modules (session, queen, learning, pheromone, etc.)
- [ ] 33-03-PLAN.md — Audit lock release on all acquire_lock callers + harden atomic_write + stale lock auto-expiry
- [ ] 33-04-PLAN.md — Dedicated data-safety.test.js + Data Safety section in /ant:status

### Phase 34: Cross-Colony Isolation
**Goal**: Two colonies running on the same machine cannot read or corrupt each other's state
**Depends on**: Phase 33 (escaping fixes prevent masking isolation bugs)
**Requirements**: SAFE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Colony name extraction uses `_colony_name()` from queen.sh instead of fragile session_id splitting — verified at learning.sh:378, learning.sh:930, aether-utils.sh:3655
  2. `LOCK_DIR` in hive.sh is passed as a function parameter, never mutated as a global variable
  3. Shared data files (pheromones.json, learning-observations.json, session.json, run-state.json) include colony namespace so two colonies writing concurrently do not overwrite each other
  4. Existing single-colony workflows still work identically (no regression)
**Plans:** 5/5 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 34-01-PLAN.md — Replace all 13 session_id splitting locations with colony-name subcommand (3 shell + 9 playbook + 1 OpenCode)
- [x] 34-02-PLAN.md — Add acquire_lock_at/release_lock_at to file-lock.sh and refactor hive.sh to eliminate LOCK_DIR mutation
- [x] 34-03-PLAN.md — Add COLONY_DATA_DIR resolution + auto-migration infrastructure, update aether-utils.sh file references
- [x] 34-04-PLAN.md — Update all 15 utils/ modules to use COLONY_DATA_DIR for per-colony file references
- [x] 34-05-PLAN.md — Integration tests for colony isolation (COLONY_DATA_DIR, migration, lock tagging, backwards compat)

### Phase 35: Colony Depth & Model Routing
**Goal**: Colony operators can control how deeply the system investigates (gating expensive agent spawns) and model routing is either functional end-to-end or honestly removed
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (colony state changes in 34 affect COLONY_STATE.json which depth selector also modifies)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `colony_depth` field exists in COLONY_STATE.json with values light/standard/deep/full, defaulting to standard
  2. Oracle spawns in build-wave.md are gated by colony depth (only spawn at deep/full), Scout spawns respect depth setting
  3. Model routing either passes the resolved model slot to the actual agent spawn call, or all model routing code (model-profiles.yaml, caste table, model-slot subcommand) is removed with a documented decision — no dead code left in between
  4. `/ant:status` or colony dashboard displays the active depth setting
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 36: YAML Command Generator
**Goal**: A single set of YAML source files produces both Claude Code and OpenCode command markdown, eliminating manual duplication of 44 commands
**Depends on**: Phase 33 (no hard dependency, but safety fixes first)
**Requirements**: INFRA-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. YAML source files exist for each command, containing the canonical command spec
  2. Running the generator script produces .claude/commands/ant/*.md and .opencode/commands/ant/*.md from YAML sources
  3. Generated output matches (or improves upon) the current hand-written command files — no loss of functionality
  4. `npm run lint:sync` validates that generated files are up-to-date with YAML sources
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 37: XML Core Integration
**Goal**: XML export/import is wired into colony lifecycle commands so cross-colony data transfer happens automatically at key moments
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (colony isolation must be solid before auto-exporting colony data)
**Requirements**: INFRA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `/ant:seal` automatically exports pheromone signals and wisdom to XML as part of the seal process
  2. `/ant:entomb` archives XML exchange files alongside the colony chamber
  3. `/ant:init` can import XML files from a previous colony to seed a new one (opt-in, not automatic)
  4. XML files in .aether/exchange/ are included in `validate-package.sh` distribution checks
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 38: Cleanup & Maintenance
**Goal**: Registry housekeeping, developer documentation, and dead code removal — small items that don't warrant their own phase
**Depends on**: Phase 33 (MAINT-02 depends on error-handler.sh being stable after escaping fixes; MAINT-03 depends on no new awk usage introduced by earlier phases)
**Requirements**: MAINT-01, MAINT-02, MAINT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Old 2.x npm versions are marked deprecated on the registry with a message pointing to current version
  2. An error code reference document exists in .aether/docs/ listing all error codes from error-handler.sh with descriptions, and is included in npm distribution
  3. The unused `models[]` awk array is removed from aether-utils.sh with no test regressions
**Plans**: TBD
