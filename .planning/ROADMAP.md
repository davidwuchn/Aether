<details>
<summary>v1.6 Release Pipeline Integrity (Phases 39-46) -- IN PROGRESS (Phases 44.1, 44.2 inserted)</summary>

### Phase 39: OpenCode Agent Frontmatter Fix
**Goal:** Fix the urgent blocker where Aether ships invalid OpenCode agent frontmatter that crashes OpenCode startup in downstream repos.
**Requirements:** OPN-01 (R068)
**Success Criteria:**
1. OpenCode launches successfully in a repo after `aether update --force`
2. All .opencode/agents/ files have valid OpenCode-schema frontmatter
3. Install/update validates agent frontmatter before writing to downstream repos
4. E2E test proves OpenCode startup does not fail on agent config
**Depends on:** none (urgent blocker)

### Phase 40: Stable Publish Hardening -- COMPLETE 2026-04-23
**Goal:** Ensure stable publish atomically syncs binary and hub to the same version -- no more 1.0.20 binary with 1.0.19 hub.
**Requirements:** PUB-01 (R059)
**Success Criteria:**
1. `aether install --package-dir "$PWD"` sets hub version.json to match source version
2. After publish, `aether version` and `~/.aether/system/version.json` agree
3. Publish fails loudly if binary and hub cannot be synchronized
4. Reproduce the current 1.0.19/1.0.20 mismatch, then prove it's fixed
**Depends on:** Phase 39 (ship frontmatter fix before touching publish)

### Phase 41: Dev-Channel Isolation -- COMPLETE 2026-04-23
**Goal:** Dev publish touches only `aether-dev` and `~/.aether-dev` -- zero contamination of stable channel.
**Requirements:** PUB-02 (R060)
**Success Criteria:**
1. Dev publish does not modify any file under `~/.aether/` or the `aether` binary
2. Stable publish does not modify any file under `~/.aether-dev/` or `aether-dev` binary
3. Both channels can be published independently without interference
4. Test proves channel isolation with concurrent publish scenarios
**Depends on:** Phase 40

### Phase 42: Downstream Stale-Publish Detection
**Goal:** `aether update --force` and `aether-dev update --force` detect and report stale/incomplete publishes instead of silently succeeding.
**Requirements:** PUB-03 (R061), PUB-04 (R061)
**Success Criteria:**
1. Downstream update detects when hub version is older than source/binary version
2. Downstream update reports exactly what is stale (binary, companion files, or both)
3. Update returns non-zero exit code on stale/incomplete publish
4. Works for both stable and dev channels independently
**Depends on:** Phase 40, Phase 41

### Phase 43: Release Integrity Checks and Diagnostics
**Goal:** Single integrity check validates the full chain (source -> binary -> hub -> downstream) and medic flags incomplete publishes with recovery commands.
**Requirements:** REL-01 (R062), REL-02 (R063)
**Success Criteria:**
1. `aether` command validates source version, binary version, hub version, and companion surfaces together
2. Medic flags incomplete stable/dev publishes and prints exact recovery command
3. Integrity check is runnable both locally (source repo) and downstream (consumer repo)
4. Diagnostic output is human-readable and actionable
**Depends on:** Phase 42

### Phase 44: Doc Alignment and Archive Consistency
**Goal:** Operations guide, runbook, and AGENTS.md match actual runtime behavior exactly. Archived milestone evidence is internally consistent.
**Requirements:** REL-03 (R064), EVD-01 (R066)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 44-01-PLAN.md -- Core docs alignment (operations guide, runbook, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, OPENCODE.md)
- [ ] 44-02-PLAN.md -- Agent/skill docs and v1.5 archive consistency

**Success Criteria:**
1. AETHER-OPERATIONS-GUIDE.md verification checklist passes as written
2. publish-update-runbook.md steps match actual command behavior
3. AGENTS.md operator flows are accurate for both channels
4. Archived v1.5 docs no longer contain internal contradictions
5. Any behavior changes from Phases 39-43 are reflected in docs
**Depends on:** Phase 43 (docs must reflect final behavior)

### Phase 44.1: Downstream Runtime Bugs (INSERTED)
**Goal:** Fix three runtime bugs found during downstream testing in Sodalitas: false Codex skills count warning, rigid plan --refresh guard, and low default scout timeout.
**Requirements:** PUB-03 (R061), EVD-02 (R067)
**Success Criteria:**
1. `aether update --force` reports correct Codex skills count (no false "1 found, expected 29")
2. `aether plan --refresh` is allowed when Phase 1 is "ready" with no built artifacts (not blocked)
3. Default scout/worker timeout raised to 15m (configurable)
4. Downstream repro confirms all three fixes work in a real repo
**Depends on:** Phase 44

### Phase 44.2: Command Hygiene and Agent Parity (INSERTED)
**Goal:** Fix aether-medic.md agent body parity mismatch between Claude and OpenCode, and rename all Aether slash commands from colon format (`ant:command`) to hyphen format (`ant-command`) to comply with current Claude Code skill naming rules.
**Requirements:** PUB-03 (R061), REL-01 (R059)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 44.2-01-PLAN.md -- Medic parity fix and colon-to-hyphen rename across repo

**Success Criteria:**
1. `TestClaudeOpenCodeAgentContentParity` passes (aether-medic.md matches between Claude and OpenCode)
2. All 50 slash commands use hyphen format (e.g., `ant-build` not `ant:build`)
3. All command references in YAML sources, wrappers, docs, and tests updated
4. `go test ./...` passes with zero failures
**Depends on:** Phase 44.1

### Phase 45: End-to-End Regression Coverage
**Goal:** Automated E2E tests for stable and dev publish/update flows that catch regressions before they ship.
**Requirements:** REL-04 (R065)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 45-01-PLAN.md -- Four E2E regression tests for stable/dev publish-update pipeline

**Success Criteria:**
1. E2E test for stable publish -> downstream update -> version agreement
2. E2E test for dev publish -> dev downstream update -> version agreement
3. E2E test for stale publish detection (intentionally stale hub)
4. E2E test for channel isolation (dev publish does not touch stable)
5. Tests runnable in CI (`go test`)
**Depends on:** Phase 43

### Phase 46: Stuck-Plan Investigation and Release Decision -- COMPLETE 2026-04-24
**Goal:** Verify the stuck `aether plan` issue; make the v1.6 release decision.
**Requirements:** EVD-02 (R067)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 46-01-PLAN.md -- Stuck-plan E2E reproduction test and v1.6 milestone audit

**Success Criteria:**
1. Stuck `aether plan` issue is reproduced or proven stale in freshly updated repos
2. If reproducible: fix shipped with regression test
3. If stale-install fallout: documented as resolved by pipeline hardening
4. All v1.6 requirements verified and milestone audit passes
5. Source, binary, hub, and downstream versions all agree for both channels
**Depends on:** Phase 44, Phase 45

<details>
<summary>v1.7 Planning Pipeline Recovery (Phases 47-48)</summary>

### Phase 47: Plan Force Recovery
**Goal:** Fix `aether plan --force` so it always recovers a colony from a bad plan, regardless of phase status, and raise the default scout timeout to reduce premature fallbacks.
**Requirements:** PLAN-01 (R069), PLAN-02 (R070), TIME-01 (R071)
**Success Criteria:**
1. `aether plan --force` resets phase status to allow replanning even when phase is `in_progress` and no real build artifacts exist
2. On `--force`, fallback planning artifacts (ROUTE-SETTER.md, phase-plan.json) are cleared so route-setter can write fresh output
3. Default scout worker timeout raised from 5m to 10m
4. `go test ./...` passes with zero failures
5. Existing plan behavior (without --force) is unchanged
**Depends on:** none (standalone fix)

### Phase 48: E2E Recovery Verification
**Goal:** Automated test proving the full recovery path: init → failed plan → --force replan → real worker plan.
**Requirements:** TEST-01 (R072)
**Success Criteria:**
1. E2E test: init colony → plan with short timeout (fallback) → plan --force → verify worker artifacts written
2. Test proves route-setter output replaces fallback artifacts after --force
3. Test proves phase status is correctly reset and replan succeeds
4. Test runnable in CI (`go test`)
**Depends on:** Phase 47
