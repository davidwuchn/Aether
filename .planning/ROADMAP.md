### v1.5 Runtime Truth Recovery (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Recover runtime truth -- close P0 bypass paths, fix atomic state advancement, and restore colony continue orchestration so active colonies can unblock.

**Milestone Goal:** Give Aether the ability to diagnose and repair its own colony data, ceremony integrity, and runtime state -- reducing manual intervention and preventing documentation gaps.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 31: P0 Runtime Truth Fixes** -- Invoker honesty, dispatch errors, continue bypass closure, git-verified claims, atomic state (completed 2026-04-22)
- [ ] **Phase 32: Continue Unblock** -- Full continue orchestration recovery
- [ ] **Phase 33: Dispatch Fixes** -- P1 dispatch robustness improvements
- [ ] **Phase 34: Cleanup** -- Stale worktrees, branches, blockers
- [ ] **Phase 35: Platform Parity** -- Claude/OpenCode/Codex alignment
- [ ] **Phase 36: Release Decision** -- v1.0.20 cut and ship decision

## Phase Details

### Phase 31: P0 Runtime Truth Fixes
**Goal:** Close all P0 truth bugs from the oracle audit -- honest invokers, error propagation, and atomic state.
**Requirements:** R045 (FakeInvoker), R046 (dispatch errors), R047 (continue bypass), R048 (reconcile), R049 (git claims), R050 (no env dismissal), R051 (atomic state)
**Status:** Complete (2026-04-22) -- 4 plans, 16 commits, 12 validation tests green

### Phase 32: Continue Unblock
**Goal:** Recover full continue orchestration so active colonies can advance past phase 2. Detect abandoned builds, produce actionable recovery messages, clear stale reports, ensure end-to-end pipeline works.
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 32-01-PLAN.md -- Abandoned build detection and recovery (TDD) (completed 2026-04-22)
- [x] 32-02-PLAN.md -- Stale report cleanup and E2E pipeline recovery (TDD) (completed 2026-04-22)

**Status:** Complete (2026-04-22) -- 2 plans, 5 commits, 5 new tests green

### Phase 33: Dispatch Fixes
**Goal:** Address P1 dispatch robustness issues from the oracle audit.
**Status:** Planned

### Phase 34: Cleanup
**Goal:** Address R056 (stale worktrees), R057 (stale branches), R058 (blocker flags).
**Status:** Planned

### Phase 35: Platform Parity
**Goal:** Align Claude/OpenCode/Codex command and agent UX.
**Status:** Planned

### Phase 36: Release Decision
**Goal:** Cut v1.0.20, validate release readiness, or defer.
**Status:** Planned
