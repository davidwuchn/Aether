# Requirements: Aether v1.2

**Defined:** 2026-03-14
**Core Value:** Colony learning loops produce visible output — decisions, instincts, midden entries, and auto-pheromones accumulate naturally during build/continue cycles.

## v1.2 Requirements

### Midden & Failure Tracking

- [ ] **MID-01**: All failure types (Watcher, Chaos, verification, Gatekeeper, Auditor) write to midden via midden-write
- [ ] **MID-02**: Approach changes during builds are captured to midden and memory-capture as abandoned-approach events
- [ ] **MID-03**: Intra-phase midden threshold check fires during build waves so REDIRECT pheromones can emit mid-build

### Decision & Pheromone Pipeline

- [ ] **DEC-01**: Decision-to-pheromone dedup format alignment verified and fixed so auto-emitted decision pheromones are correctly deduplicated in continue-advance Step 2.1b

### Learnings & Instinct Pipeline

- [ ] **LRN-01**: Instinct confidence uses recurrence-calibrated scoring based on observation_count from learning-observations.json rather than fixed 0.7

### Memory Capture & Colony-Prime

- [ ] **MEM-01**: Success capture fires at build-verify (chaos resilience) and build-complete (pattern synthesis) call sites via memory-capture "success"
- [ ] **MEM-02**: Rolling-summary last 5 entries fed into colony-prime output so workers have recent activity awareness

## Future Requirements

### Differentiators (deferred to v1.3)

- **D3**: High-confidence instincts (>=0.85) echo as FOCUS pheromones before each build wave
- **D4**: User-feedback pheromones with strength > 0.7 auto-create instincts with confidence 0.9
- **D1**: Confidence decay for unverified instincts
- **D2**: Cross-phase midden pattern surfacing via midden-pattern-summary

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Automatic pheromone from every decision | Signal saturation — 3-per-continue cap exists for this reason |
| Real-time instinct updates during build | Concurrent write conflicts — instinct store designed for phase-boundary updates |
| Midden as blocking gate | Midden is a record system, not a quality gate — Gatekeeper handles blocking |
| New subcommands or state files | All infrastructure exists — this is wiring, not building |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| MEM-01 | Phase 12 | Pending |
| MEM-02 | Phase 12 | Pending |
| MID-01 | Phase 13 | Pending |
| MID-02 | Phase 13 | Pending |
| MID-03 | Phase 13 | Pending |
| DEC-01 | Phase 14 | Pending |
| LRN-01 | Phase 14 | Pending |
