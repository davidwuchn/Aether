# Requirements: Oracle Deep Research Engine

**Defined:** 2026-03-13
**Core Value:** The oracle produces research you can act on -- verified, iteratively deepened, structured for the topic.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for the oracle deep research upgrade. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Core Loop (Ralph Pattern)

- [ ] **LOOP-01**: Oracle uses structured state files (state.json, plan.json, gaps.md, synthesis.md) to bridge context between stateless iterations -- not flat progress.md append
- [ ] **LOOP-02**: Each iteration reads structured state first, then targets the highest-priority knowledge gap -- gap-driven iteration, not topic-based
- [ ] **LOOP-03**: Oracle uses phase-aware prompts (survey -> investigate -> synthesize -> verify) that change behavior based on research lifecycle stage
- [ ] **LOOP-04**: Convergence detection uses structural metrics (gap resolution rate, novelty rate, coverage completeness) -- not self-assessed confidence alone

### Research Intelligence

- [ ] **INTL-01**: Oracle decomposes topic into 3-8 tracked sub-questions with status (open/partial/answered)
- [ ] **INTL-02**: After each iteration, oracle identifies remaining unknowns and contradictions, updating gaps.md
- [ ] **INTL-03**: Per-question confidence scoring (0-100%) drives which areas get researched next
- [ ] **INTL-04**: Research plan visible as research-plan.md showing questions, status, confidence, and next steps
- [ ] **INTL-05**: Reflection loop detects diminishing returns and triggers strategy changes

### Output Quality

- [ ] **OUTP-01**: Final output is a structured, synthesized report with sections, executive summary, and findings organized by sub-question
- [ ] **OUTP-02**: On stop or max-iterations, oracle runs a synthesis pass producing useful partial results
- [ ] **OUTP-03**: Output structure adapts to the specific research topic (not one-size-fits-all template)

### Trust & Verification

- [ ] **TRST-01**: Every claim tracks its source (URL + title + date)
- [ ] **TRST-02**: Single-source claims flagged as low confidence; key claims require 2+ independent sources
- [ ] **TRST-03**: Sources collected in a dedicated section with inline citations in findings

### Steering & Control

- [ ] **STRC-01**: User can steer research mid-session via pheromone signals (FOCUS/REDIRECT/FEEDBACK) read between iterations
- [ ] **STRC-02**: Configurable search strategy in wizard: breadth-first, depth-first, or adaptive
- [ ] **STRC-03**: Configurable focus areas to prioritize certain aspects of the research

### Colony Integration

- [ ] **COLN-01**: High-confidence research findings can be promoted to colony instincts/learnings after completion
- [ ] **COLN-02**: Pre-built research strategy templates for common patterns (tech eval, architecture review, bug investigation, best practices)

## Future Requirements

### Advanced Research

- **ADVN-01**: Knowledge graph construction during research
- **ADVN-02**: Parallel sub-question research (spawn multiple AI instances)
- **ADVN-03**: Source credibility scoring (domain authority, recency)
- **ADVN-04**: Multi-scope research (dynamic per-question scope switching)
- **ADVN-05**: Research artifacts (comparison tables, decision matrices, glossaries)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time web scraping / browser automation | Massive complexity; WebSearch/WebFetch handles 95% of needs |
| Academic database integration (PubMed, arXiv APIs) | Dev tool, not academic research tool; web search surfaces academic results |
| Multi-user collaboration | Aether is single-developer CLI; pheromone steering covers the use case |
| Autonomous scope expansion | Runaway scope is the #1 failure mode; strict scoping to user-defined questions |
| Custom LLM model selection per phase | Configuration complexity; better prompts > model switching |
| Persistent cross-session research memory | Unbounded context growth; colony integration captures durable knowledge |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LOOP-01 | Phase 6 | Pending |
| LOOP-02 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| LOOP-03 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| LOOP-04 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| INTL-01 | Phase 6 | Pending |
| INTL-02 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| INTL-03 | Phase 7 | Pending |
| INTL-04 | Phase 6 | Pending |
| INTL-05 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| OUTP-01 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| OUTP-02 | Phase 8 | Pending |
| OUTP-03 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| TRST-01 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| TRST-02 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| TRST-03 | Phase 9 | Pending |
| STRC-01 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| STRC-02 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| STRC-03 | Phase 10 | Pending |
| COLN-01 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| COLN-02 | Phase 11 | Pending |
