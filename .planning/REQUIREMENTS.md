# Requirements: Aether Colony Wiring

**Defined:** 2026-03-06
**Core Value:** Workers automatically receive all relevant context — the colony improves itself.

## v1 Requirements

### Learnings Pipeline

- [ ] **LEARN-01**: Validated phase learnings auto-inject into builder prompts via colony-prime
- [ ] **LEARN-02**: continue-advance calls instinct-create for patterns with confidence >= 0.7
- [ ] **LEARN-03**: instinct-read results included in colony-prime prompt_section output
- [ ] **LEARN-04**: Phase learnings from previous phases visible to current phase builders

### Pheromone Auto-Emission

- [ ] **PHER-01**: Key decisions recorded during continue auto-emit FEEDBACK pheromones
- [ ] **PHER-02**: Recurring error patterns (3+ occurrences) auto-emit REDIRECT pheromones
- [ ] **PHER-03**: Success criteria patterns auto-emit FEEDBACK on recurrence across phases

### QUEEN.md Wisdom Promotion

- [ ] **QUEEN-01**: continue-finalize calls learning-promote-auto to check promotion thresholds
- [ ] **QUEEN-02**: seal.md calls queen-promote for observations meeting thresholds
- [ ] **QUEEN-03**: queen-read output included in colony-prime prompt_section for builder context

### Context Completeness

- [ ] **CTX-01**: colony-prime reads CONTEXT.md and extracts key decisions for builder injection
- [ ] **CTX-02**: Escalated blocker flags inject as REDIRECT warnings into builder prompts

## v2 Requirements

### Cross-Colony Learning

- **CROSS-01**: New colonies inherit instincts from sealed colonies
- **CROSS-02**: QUEEN.md wisdom persists across colony lifecycles
- **CROSS-03**: Midden patterns from previous colonies surface in new colony builds

### Self-Audit

- **AUDIT-01**: Colony periodically measures its own learning pipeline health
- **AUDIT-02**: Dream observations trigger automatic gap-closing actions

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New slash commands | Connect what exists, don't add surface area |
| New agent types | 22 agents is sufficient |
| UI/visual changes | This is plumbing, not paint |
| Model routing verification | Separate concern, not integration work |
| XML migration | Do gradually as files are touched |
| Cross-repo wisdom sharing | Solve single-colony learning first |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LEARN-01 | Phase 2 | Pending |
| LEARN-02 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| LEARN-03 | Phase 1 | Pending |
| LEARN-04 | Phase 2 | Pending |
| PHER-01 | Phase 4 | Pending |
| PHER-02 | Phase 4 | Pending |
| PHER-03 | Phase 4 | Pending |
| QUEEN-01 | Phase 5 | Pending |
| QUEEN-02 | Phase 5 | Pending |
| QUEEN-03 | Phase 5 | Pending |
| CTX-01 | Phase 3 | Pending |
| CTX-02 | Phase 3 | Pending |
