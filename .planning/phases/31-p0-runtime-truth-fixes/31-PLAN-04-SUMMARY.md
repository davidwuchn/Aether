# Phase 31 Plan 04: Git-Verified Claims and Integration Tests Summary

In-repo build claims are now git-verified for all completed workers, with integration tests proving all bypass paths are closed.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 04-01: Git-verify in-repo build claims for completed workers
- **Status:** Verified (previously committed in 0b61318b)
- **Commit:** 0b61318b
- **What:** The `applyObservedClaims` function now runs for ALL completed workers in the in-repo dispatch path, regardless of whether the worker result was previously completed. Previously, only non-completed workers had their claims checked against git state; completed workers were trusted blindly.
- **Files:** cmd/codex_build_worktree.go

### Task 04-02: Remove environmental dismissal for test and verification failures
- **Status:** Verified (previously committed in Plan 02)
- **Commit:** cb4dfdb1 (watcher timeout bypass), add10b56 (verified_partial bypass)
- **What:** Confirmed that `cmd/codex_continue.go` contains zero references to "environmental" dismissal. The `runVerificationStep` function produces honest summaries with actual error output via `failureSummaryForStep`. No logic exists that marks real failures as transient or environmental.
- **Files:** cmd/codex_continue.go

### Task 04-03: Add integration tests for all closed bypass paths
- **Status:** Committed
- **Commit:** 1a7bdd1c
- **What:** Four integration tests prove bypass paths stay closed:
  - `TestContinue_BlocksOnVerifiedPartial` — Phase blocks when any worker failed, even if verification steps pass
  - `TestContinue_BlocksOnWatcherTimeout` — Watcher timeout prevents phase advancement, sets checksPassed=false
  - `TestContinue_ReconcileDoesNotBypassClaims` — Reconcile does not advance phase without git evidence
  - `TestBuildInRepo_VerifiesGitClaimsForCompletedWorkers` — In-repo claims are verified against actual git state
- **Files:** cmd/codex_build_test.go, cmd/codex_continue_test.go

## Verification Results

- `go build ./cmd/aether` succeeds
- `go test ./cmd/... -run "Build|Continue"` passes (all tests green)
- `go test ./cmd/... -run "BlocksOnVerifiedPartial|BlocksOnWatcherTimeout|ReconcileDoesNotBypassClaims|VerifiesGitClaimsForCompletedWorkers" -v` passes
- `grep -rn "environmental" cmd/codex_continue.go` returns no matches

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All three tasks were already implemented from prior plan work; the integration tests (Task 04-03) were present in the working tree and committed in this execution.

## Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| 1a7bdd1c | test(31-04): integration tests for closed bypass paths |
| 0b61318b | fix(build): git-verify in-repo claims for all completed workers |

## Self-Check: PASSED

- SUMMARY.md exists at expected path
- Commit 1a7bdd1c found in git log
- Commit 0b61318b found in git log
- `go build ./cmd/aether` succeeds
- All four integration tests pass
