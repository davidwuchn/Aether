# Phase 34 Plan 01: Backup Colony Data and Evaluate Candidate Commits Summary

**Colony data backed up to timestamped directory; both candidate commits evaluated and dismissed as redundant with main.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~5 min (continuation agent)
- **Started:** 2026-04-23T01:06:40Z
- **Completed:** 2026-04-23T01:06:40Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3 (backed up, not source files)

## Accomplishments
- Created timestamped backup of critical colony data files at `.aether/data/backups/cleanup-20260423-030321/`
- Evaluated both candidate commits (claude-dispatch-ux and intent-workflows) against current main
- User decided both commits are redundant -- their useful code already exists on main in different forms
- No preserve/ branches needed; no code lost

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Backup .aether/data/ colony files** - Not committed to git (backup files are in `.aether/data/` which is gitignored -- they are local colony data, not source code). Backup verified on disk with 3 files: COLONY_STATE.json (19,586 bytes), pending-decisions.json (13,350 bytes), session.json (1,529 bytes).
2. **Task 2: Evaluate and decide on candidate commits** - Decision only, no code changes needed.

**Note:** No git commits were required for this plan. The backup is local data (gitignored), and the commit evaluation resulted in a "dismiss" decision with no preserve branches to create.

## Files Created/Modified
- `.aether/data/backups/cleanup-20260423-030321/COLONY_STATE.json` - Colony state backup (19,586 bytes)
- `.aether/data/backups/cleanup-20260423-030321/pending-decisions.json` - Pending decisions backup (13,350 bytes)
- `.aether/data/backups/cleanup-20260423-030321/session.json` - Session state backup (1,529 bytes)

Note: pheromones.json and constraints.json were not present in `.aether/data/` at backup time, so they were skipped.

## Decisions Made
- **Both commits dismissed as redundant:** User confirmed that the useful code from both candidate commits (98cda871 claude-dispatch-ux and 4bbb9273 intent-workflows) already exists on main in different forms. No preservation or integration needed.
- **No preserve/ branches created:** Per user directive, no preserve/ branches were created. Both commits' value has been absorbed into main through other work.

## Deviations from Plan

### User Decision Override

**1. [Checkpoint Decision] User dismissed both commits instead of preserving**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Evaluate and decide on candidate commits)
- **Issue:** Plan's `must_haves` stated "preserve/ branches exist for commits not integrated into main" but user decided both commits are fully redundant
- **Resolution:** User explicitly stated: "both commits are not needed -- their useful code is already on main. No preserve branches, no integration. Just skip them."
- **Impact:** No preserve/ branches created. This is a deliberate user decision, not a gap. Git history retains the commits by SHA so they are recoverable if ever needed.

---

**Total deviations:** 1 user decision override
**Impact on plan:** No scope creep. User decision is definitive and reduces cleanup scope.

## Issues Encountered
- Only 3 of 6 planned backup files existed in `.aether/data/` (pheromones.json, constraints.json, and flags.json were absent). This is expected for a colony that has been inactive.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Backup in place before any destructive cleanup
- Candidate commits resolved -- no blockers for branch/worktree cleanup in plan 34-02
- Ready to proceed with bulk worktree and branch cleanup (34-02) with interactive confirmation

## Self-Check: PASSED
