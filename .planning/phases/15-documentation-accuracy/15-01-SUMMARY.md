requires:
  - phase: 13-monolith-modularization
    provides: dispatcher + 9 domain module architecture (5,262 lines from 11,663)
  - phase: 14-planning-depth
    provides: research step and context injection into builder/watcher prompts
provides:
  - "Accurate CLAUDE.md reflecting post-hardening system state"
  - "Correct trim order documentation matching pheromone.sh code"
  - "Modular architecture diagram showing dispatcher + 9 domain modules"

# Phase 15 Plan 01: CLAUDE.md Accuracy Summary

**Fixed CRITICAL inverted trim order, updated all stale counts (lines, subcommands, utils, tests), and rewrote architecture diagram to show dispatcher + 9 domain modules**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-24T12:14:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-24T12:16:38Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Fixed CRITICAL trim order inversion (rolling-summary is trimmed FIRST, not last as previously documented)
- Updated all stale pre-modularization counts: 11,221->~5,200 lines, 125->~150 subcommands, 18->~29 utils, 530+->580+ tests
- Rewrote architecture diagram to show dispatcher + 9 domain modules + infrastructure + XML utilities
- Added Gatekeeper scope caveat per Oracle finding

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix CLAUDE.md counts, trim order, and architecture** - `42f3fa5` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified
- `CLAUDE.md` - Internal developer reference updated with accurate post-hardening state

## Decisions Made
- Used ~ approximations for all counts per user decision (less maintenance burden)
- Added Gatekeeper scope caveat (~6 patterns, not full scanner) per Oracle finding
- Kept v2.0.0 version throughout -- Phase 16 bumps to v2.1.0
- Updated slash command counts to ~44 (was 43 at v2.0 launch, now 44)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- CLAUDE.md is now accurate for post-hardening state
- Plan 02 (README.md rewrite) can proceed -- verified counts established here should be reused
- Plan 03 (docs/ sweep + CHANGELOG) can proceed independently

## Self-Check: PASSED

- FOUND: CLAUDE.md
- FOUND: 15-01-SUMMARY.md
- FOUND: commit 42f3fa5 (task 1)
- FOUND: commit 4a135f8 (metadata)
