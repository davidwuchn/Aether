## Introduction

This file is the developer-facing guide for using **Aether** with **OpenAI Codex CLI**.
It explains how the Aether multi-agent colony system works when Codex is the AI platform,
what files live where, and how to develop effectively.

**Relationship to AGENTS.md:** The project-root `AGENTS.md` contains Codex system instructions
that Codex CLI reads automatically. This file (`.codex/CODEX.md`) is a deeper developer
reference for humans and agents working within the Codex platform. Think of AGENTS.md as
"what Codex needs to know" and this file as "what a developer needs to know."

## How Development Works

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
|  In the Aether repo, .aether/ IS the source of truth.           |
|  Edit system files there and publish directly.                  |
|                                                                 |
|  .aether/           -> SOURCE OF TRUTH (edit this, published)   |
|  .aether/data/      -> LOCAL ONLY (never distributed)            |
|  .aether/dreams/    -> LOCAL ONLY (never distributed)            |
|                                                                 |
|  .codex/agents/     -> SOURCE OF TRUTH (Codex agent TOML defs)  |
|  AGENTS.md          -> SOURCE OF TRUTH (Codex system prompt)    |
|                                                                 |
|  `aether install --package-dir "$PWD"` refreshes hub files      |
|  and Codex assets from this checkout.                           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

| What you're changing | Where to edit | Why |
|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| Agent definitions | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | Source of truth for Codex agents |
| System prompt | `AGENTS.md` (project root) | Codex reads this automatically |
| Colony rules | `.aether/workers.md` | Source of truth |
| Aether CLI | `cmd/` (Go binary) | Platform-agnostic |
| User docs | `.aether/docs/` | Synced via `aether install` / `aether update` |

**After editing:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
aether install --package-dir "$PWD"
```

---

## Critical Architecture

**`.aether/` + `.codex/` are the source of truth.** Release binaries embed the shipped
companion files, and local development can publish directly from this checkout with
`aether install --package-dir "$PWD"`. Codex agent TOML files live in `.codex/agents/`
and sync to the hub alongside the other platform files.

```

|   +-- dreams/        <- LOCAL ONLY (excluded)

```

## Key Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Syncs to Hub |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `.codex/agents/` | Codex agent definitions (TOML) | -> `~/.aether/system/codex/` |
| `AGENTS.md` | Codex system instructions | Template-generated at setup |
| `.aether/` (system files) | Source of truth for workers, utils, docs | -> `~/.aether/system/` |
| `.aether/agents-codex/` | Codex packaging mirror | Embedded alongside hub assets |
| `.aether/skills-codex/` | Codex-installed skill mirror | -> `~/.aether/system/skills-codex/` |
| `.aether/data/` | Colony state | **NEVER touched** |
| `.aether/dreams/` | Session notes | **NEVER touched** |

---

## Codex-Specific Conventions

### No Slash Commands

Codex CLI does **not** support slash commands like Claude Code (`/ant:build`) or OpenCode.
Instead, all colony operations use the **`aether` CLI directly** or are described as natural
language prompts in `AGENTS.md`.

```bash
# Instead of /ant:init "Build feature X"
aether init "Build feature X"

# Instead of /ant:build 1
aether build 1

# Instead of /ant:status
aether status

# Instead of /ant:pheromones
aether pheromone-display
```

When the user message is already a literal `aether ...` command, execute that exact CLI
command first. Do not inspect repo files to infer intent, and do not treat command-doc
mirrors as more authoritative than the installed `aether` binary. For lifecycle commands
run through Codex shell execution, prefer `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether ...` unless the
user explicitly wants JSON output.
Do not preface literal commands with repo archaeology, skill narration, or
"I'm checking..." commentary. Let the CLI output stand on its own and keep any
extra explanation to one short sentence unless the user asks for more.

### Agent Definitions (TOML Format)

Codex agent definitions live in `.codex/agents/*.toml` using the TOML configuration format.
Each file defines one agent with its instructions embedded inline.

**Format:**
```toml
name = "aether-builder"
description = "Use this agent for code implementation..."
nickname_candidates = ["builder", "hammer"]

developer_instructions = '''
You are a **Builder Ant** in the Aether Colony...
[Full agent instructions here]
'''
```

**Key differences from other platforms:**

| Aspect | Claude Code | OpenCode | Codex |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Format | Markdown (`.md`) | Markdown (`.md`) | TOML (`.toml`) |
| Location | `.claude/agents/ant/` | `.opencode/agents/` | `.codex/agents/` |
| Instructions | File content | File content | `developer_instructions` field |
| Metadata | In file header | In file header | TOML keys (`name`, `description`) |

### Skills

The shared skill sources live in `.aether/skills/` and `.aether/skills-codex/`.
For Codex, installed skills are copied into `.codex/skills/aether/` and matched by
the `aether skill-*` commands against worker role, workspace files, and package manifests.

Skills are not a separate Codex plugin bundle. Codex agent definitions remain in
`.codex/agents/*.toml`, and the Go CLI handles skill indexing, matching, and injection.

Skills are automatically matched and injected into worker prompts during `build`,
`colonize`, and `plan` dispatches.

### Pheromone Signals

Active pheromone signals are automatically injected into worker prompts during
`build`, `colonize`, and `plan` dispatches.

Pheromone signals work identically across all platforms via the `aether` CLI:

```bash
# Set signals
aether pheromone-write --type FOCUS --content "security"
aether pheromone-write --type REDIRECT --content "avoid global state"
aether pheromone-write --type FEEDBACK --content "prefer composition"

# View signals
aether pheromone-display

# Export/import for cross-colony sharing
aether pheromone-export
aether pheromone-import --file signals.xml
```

---

## Workflow for Codex Users

### Colony Setup

```bash
# Initialize colony with a goal
aether init "Build feature X"

# Analyze existing codebase (optional)
aether colonize

# Generate phase plan
aether plan

# Preview or run the autopilot loop
aether run --dry-run
aether run --max-phases 2

# Build a phase (workers execute)
aether build 1

# Verify, learn, advance
aether continue

# Live worker view and autonomous research loop
aether watch
aether oracle "release concern"

# Finish the colony
aether seal
```

### Status and Monitoring

```bash
aether status           # Colony dashboard
aether phase            # Current phase details
aether phase 3          # Specific phase
aether watch            # Live worker activity alias
aether swarm --watch    # Live worker activity
aether flags            # Active flags
aether flag --title "Investigate auth bug"
aether history          # Colony events
aether memory-details   # Drill-down memory view
aether patrol           # System health check
```

### Pheromone Signals

```bash
# Guide colony before builds
aether focus "security"                   # Pay attention here
aether redirect "avoid global state"       # Hard constraint
aether feedback "prefer early returns"     # Gentle adjustment

# View and manage
aether pheromones                          # Full signal table
aether pheromone-display                   # Formatted with strength %
aether export-signals                      # Share across colonies
aether import-signals --file signals.xml   # Import signals
```

### Lifecycle

```bash
aether seal              # Seal colony (Crowned Anthill)
aether update            # Pull latest from hub
aether resume            # Restore saved session context
```

### Advanced

```bash
aether preferences "prefer verbose output"
aether phase-insert --after 1 --name "Fix auth" --description "Stabilize auth flow"
aether run --headless --max-phases 3
aether swarm "build flakes in auth"
aether oracle "auth flake investigation"
aether skill-match --role builder --task "react form validation"
aether skill-inject --role builder --task "react form validation"
aether data-clean        # Clean test artifacts
```

## Development Rules

### Editing Files

| What | Where to edit | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Codex agent defs | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | TOML format; `developer_instructions` field holds content |
| System prompt | `AGENTS.md` | Project root; Codex reads this automatically |
| Colony workers | `.aether/workers.md` | Shared across all platforms |
| Go CLI | `cmd/` | Platform-agnostic; no changes needed for Codex |
| Skills | `.aether/skills/` | Shared across all platforms |
| Templates | `.aether/templates/` | Includes Codex template |

### Protected Paths

Never write to these programmatically:

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `.aether/data/` | Colony state (COLONY_STATE.json, session files) |
| `.aether/dreams/` | Dream journal entries |
| `.codex/config.toml` | Codex configuration |
| `.env*` | Environment secrets |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI configuration |

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Go tests
go test ./...
go test ./... -race

# Build verification
go build ./cmd/aether

# Lint
go vet ./...

# Binary smoke test
./aether version

# Verify Codex agent files are valid TOML
for f in .codex/agents/*.toml; do
  echo "Checking $f..."
  # Basic syntax check -- TOML is simple enough for grep validation
done

# Verify all 25 agents exist
ls .codex/agents/*.toml | wc -l  # Should be 25
```

### Publishing Changes

Authoritative runbook: `.aether/docs/publish-update-runbook.md`

```bash
# 1. Edit files in .codex/ or .aether/
# 2. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "update codex agent definitions"

# 3. Refresh the hub from this source checkout
aether install --package-dir "$PWD"

# 4. In other repos, pull updates
aether update --force
```

Runtime note:
- `aether install --package-dir "$PWD"` publishes unreleased companion-file and runtime changes on this machine from the current Aether checkout.
- `aether update` in other repos only syncs from the shared hub. It does not publish local source changes, and without `--force` it can leave stale Aether-managed files behind.
- `aether update --force --download-binary` is the published-release path when you also need the release runtime binary.
- `.aether/version.json` is the source-checkout release version file. `npm/package.json` must match it exactly for published releases.
- If `aether update --force` shows `Commands (claude)` or `Commands (opencode)` as `0 copied, 0 unchanged`, the hub publish is incomplete. Republish from the Aether repo first, then rerun `aether update --force` in the target repo.
- If the change modifies `aether install` itself, bootstrap once with `go run ./cmd/aether install --package-dir "$PWD" --binary-dest "$HOME/.local/bin"`.
- Published release flow: bump `.aether/version.json` and `npm/package.json` to the same version, push the commit, then push tag `vX.Y.Z`.

## Comparison with Claude Code and OpenCode

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Claude Code | OpenCode | Codex |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| System prompt file | `CLAUDE.md` | `.opencode/OPENCODE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Agent format | Markdown `.md` | Markdown `.md` | TOML `.toml` |
| Agent location | `.claude/agents/ant/` | `.opencode/agents/` | `.codex/agents/` |
| Slash commands | Yes (50 commands) | Yes (50 commands) | **No** -- use `aether` CLI |
| Command location | `.claude/commands/ant/` | `.opencode/commands/ant/` | N/A |
| Agent metadata | In markdown header | In markdown header | TOML keys |
| Hub sync path | `~/.aether/agents/` | `~/.aether/agents/` | `~/.aether/system/codex/` + `~/.aether/system/skills-codex/` |
| Worker runtime | `Task` tool | `Task` tool | `codex exec` driven by `aether` |
| Rules file | `.claude/rules/` | Inline | `AGENTS.md` sections |

### What is the same

- **Go binary** (`cmd/aether`) is platform-agnostic -- all three platforms use the same CLI
- **Colony state** (`.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json`) works identically
- **Pheromone signals** work via `aether pheromone-*` commands on all platforms
- **Skills system** (`.aether/skills/`) is shared and platform-agnostic
- **Hub sync** (`~/.aether/`) distributes to all platforms from the same source
- **Memory/learning pipeline** (wisdom, instincts, hive) is identical
- **TDD discipline** and coding standards apply regardless of platform

### Workflow Translation

| Goal | Claude Code | OpenCode | Codex |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Start colony | `/ant:init "goal"` | `/ant:init "goal"` | `aether init "goal"` |
| Build phase | `/ant:build 1` | `/ant:build 1` | `aether build 1` |
| Check status | `/ant:status` | `/ant:status` | `aether status` |
| Focus signal | `/ant:focus "area"` | `/ant:focus "area"` | `aether focus "area"` |
| Update Aether | `/ant:update` | `/ant:update` | `aether update` |
| Seal colony | `/ant:seal` | `/ant:seal` | `aether seal` |
| Deep research | `/ant:oracle` | `/ant:oracle` | Use the `aether-oracle` agent plus `aether skill-*` and research commands |
| View pheromones | `/ant:pheromones` | `/ant:pheromones` | `aether pheromone-display` |
