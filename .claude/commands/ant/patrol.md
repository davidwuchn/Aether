description: "🐜🔦 Patrol the colony — comprehensive pre-seal review of all work against the plan"
---


You are the **Queen**. Send patrol ants through the colony before sealing.



## Instructions

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- If contains `--no-visual`: set `visual_mode = false` (visual is ON by default)
- Otherwise: set `visual_mode = true`

<failure_modes>
### State Read Failure
If COLONY_STATE.json is missing or unreadable:
- Report: "No colony initialized. Run /ant:init first."
- Stop immediately.

### Test Command Failure
If npm test or bash test suites fail to run:
- Record the failure in the report as "Tests: UNABLE TO RUN"
- Continue with remaining audit steps (non-blocking)

### Subagent Spawn Failure
If a scout or watcher agent fails to spawn:
- Fall back to running the verification inline (Queen does it directly)
- Note the fallback in the report
</failure_modes>

<success_criteria>
Command is complete when:
- All 8 audit steps have been executed
- completion-report.md is written to .aether/data/
- User sees formatted audit results with pass/fail indicators
- No files were modified except completion-report.md
</success_criteria>

<read_only>
Do not touch during audit (except completion-report.md):
- .aether/dreams/ (user notes)
- .aether/chambers/ (archived colonies)
- Source code files
- .env* files
- .claude/settings.json
- COLONY_STATE.json (read-only during audit)
- CLAUDE.md (read-only during audit)
</read_only>

### Step 1: Load Colony State

Read these files in parallel using the Read tool:
- `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json`
- `CLAUDE.md`

If `COLONY_STATE.json` is missing or `goal: null`:
```
No colony initialized. Run /ant:init first.
```
Stop here.

Extract from COLONY_STATE.json:
- `goal` — colony objective
- `state` — current state (IDLE, READY, EXECUTING, PLANNING)
- `current_phase` — active phase number
- `plan.phases` — all phases with tasks and statuses
- `memory.instincts` — learned patterns
- `memory.phase_learnings` — phase-specific learnings
- `memory.decisions` — recorded decisions
- `events` — event log
- `milestone` — current milestone
- `initialized_at` — colony start time
- `version` — state version

Display audit header:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 C O L O N Y   A U D I T
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Goal: {goal}
Milestone: {milestone}
State: {state}
Auditing...
```

Initialize tracking variables:
- `audit_issues = []` — list of issues found
- `audit_passes = 0` — count of checks that passed
- `audit_fails = 0` — count of checks that failed
- `audit_warnings = 0` — count of warnings

### Step 2: Plan vs Reality Verification

Display: `Verifying plan against codebase...`

For each phase in `plan.phases`:

1. **Check phase status:** Record whether status is "completed", "in_progress", or "pending"

2. **Verify task evidence:** For each task in the phase:
   - Parse the task description for verifiable claims:
     - If description mentions "create" or "add" a file: use Glob to check the file exists
     - If description mentions "subcommand" or "command": use Grep to search for it in the codebase
     - If description mentions "update" or "modify" a file: use Glob to check the file exists
     - If description mentions "test": use Glob to check test files exist
   - Classify each task as:
     - **VERIFIED** — evidence found in codebase
     - **UNVERIFIABLE** — task description too vague to verify programmatically
     - **MISSING** — task claims to create/modify something that doesn't exist

3. **Compile results:**
   ```
   Phase {N}: {name} [{status}]
     Tasks: {verified} verified | {unverifiable} unverifiable | {missing} missing evidence
     {For each MISSING task: "  MISSING: {task description}"}
   ```

Track totals:
- `total_tasks`, `verified_tasks`, `unverifiable_tasks`, `missing_tasks`

If `missing_tasks > 0`: increment `audit_fails` and add to `audit_issues`
Otherwise: increment `audit_passes`

### Step 3: Documentation Accuracy Audit

Display: `Auditing documentation accuracy...`

Spawn a **Watcher** using Task tool with `subagent_type="aether-watcher"`:

```xml
<task>
  <description>Documentation accuracy audit for colony pre-seal review</description>
  <prompt>
You are a Watcher Ant performing a documentation accuracy audit.

Mission: Verify that key documentation files accurately reflect the current codebase state.

**IMPORTANT:** You are strictly read-only. Do not modify any files.

## Checks to Perform

### 1. Command Count Verification
- Count files in .claude/commands/ant/ (use Glob: .claude/commands/ant/*.md)
- Count files in .opencode/commands/ant/ (use Glob: .opencode/commands/ant/*.md)
- Read CLAUDE.md and find the claimed command count (look for "Slash commands" in Quick Reference table)
- Compare: do counts match claimed numbers?

### 2. Agent Count Verification
- Count files in .claude/agents/ant/ (use Glob: .claude/agents/ant/*.md)
- Read CLAUDE.md and find the claimed agent count (look for "Agent definitions" in Quick Reference)
- Compare: do counts match?

### 3. Version Consistency
- Read version from CLAUDE.md (look for "Current Version" in Quick Reference)
- Read version from package.json (if exists)
- Read version from .aether/docs/source-of-truth-map.md (if exists)
- Compare: are all versions consistent?

### 4. Colony Rules Verification
- Read .claude/rules/aether-colony.md
- Check the "Available Commands" table — does it list all commands that exist in .claude/commands/ant/?
- Identify any commands that exist as files but are missing from the table
- Identify any commands listed in the table but missing as files

### 5. Source of Truth Map Spot-Check
- Read .aether/docs/source-of-truth-map.md (if exists)
- Pick 3-5 entries and verify the claimed paths exist
- Report any broken references

## Output

Return ONLY this JSON (no other text):
{
  "ant_name": "audit-watcher",
  "caste": "watcher",
  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Documentation accuracy audit results",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "command_count",
      "status": "PASS|FAIL|WARN",
      "expected": "value from docs",
      "actual": "value from codebase",
      "detail": "explanation"
    },
    {
      "name": "agent_count",
      "status": "PASS|FAIL|WARN",
      "expected": "value from docs",
      "actual": "value from codebase",
      "detail": "explanation"
    },
    {
      "name": "version_consistency",
      "status": "PASS|FAIL|WARN",
      "expected": "all same",
      "actual": "list of versions found",
      "detail": "explanation"
    },
    {
      "name": "colony_rules_commands",
      "status": "PASS|FAIL|WARN",
      "expected": "all commands listed",
      "actual": "missing or extra commands",
      "detail": "explanation"
    },
    {
      "name": "source_of_truth_map",
      "status": "PASS|FAIL|WARN",
      "expected": "all paths valid",
      "actual": "broken paths if any",
      "detail": "explanation"
    }
  ],
  "accuracy_score": 0,
  "blockers": []
}
  </prompt>
</task>
```

**FALLBACK:** If "Agent type not found", use general-purpose agent and inject role: "You are a Watcher Ant - quality specialist that validates accuracy and consistency."

**Parse Watcher output:**
Extract `checks` array and `accuracy_score`.

For each check:
- If `status == "PASS"`: increment `audit_passes`
- If `status == "FAIL"`: increment `audit_fails`, add to `audit_issues`
- If `status == "WARN"`: increment `audit_warnings`, add to `audit_issues`

Display:
```
Documentation Accuracy:
  {For each check: "[PASS|FAIL|WARN] {name}: {detail}"}
  Score: {accuracy_score}%
```

### Step 4: Unresolved Issues Review

Display: `Reviewing unresolved issues...`

Run these commands in parallel using the Bash tool:

**Flags check:**
```bash
bash .aether/aether-utils.sh flag-list 2>/dev/null || echo '{"result":{"flags":[]}}'
```

**Midden check:**
```bash
bash .aether/aether-utils.sh midden-recent-failures 2>/dev/null || echo '{"result":{"failures":[]}}'
```

**Parse flag results:**
- Count unresolved flags by severity (blocker, high, medium, low)
- List any unresolved blockers with their titles

**Parse midden results:**
- Look for recurring patterns (same error type appearing 3+ times)
- List recurring failure patterns

Display:
```
Unresolved Issues:
  Flags: {blocker_count} blockers | {high_count} high | {medium_count} medium | {low_count} low
  {For each unresolved blocker: "  BLOCKER: {title}"}
  Midden: {failure_count} recent failures | {recurring_count} recurring patterns
  {For each recurring pattern: "  RECURRING: {pattern}"}
```

If `blocker_count > 0`: increment `audit_fails`, add blockers to `audit_issues`
If `recurring_count > 0`: increment `audit_warnings`, add to `audit_issues`
Otherwise: increment `audit_passes`

### Step 5: Test Coverage Summary

Display: `Checking test coverage...`


**Count test files created during colony lifetime:**



Run using the Bash tool:
```bash
# Count test files
test_count_unit=$(ls -1 tests/unit/*.test.sh 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
test_count_e2e=$(ls -1 tests/e2e/*.test.sh 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
test_count_js=$(find . -name "*.test.js" -o -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.spec.js" -o -name "*.spec.ts" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
echo "unit=$test_count_unit"
echo "e2e=$test_count_e2e"
echo "js=$test_count_js"
echo "total=$((test_count_unit + test_count_e2e + test_count_js))"
```

**Run test suites (capture counts, do not block on failure):**

Run using the Bash tool (with timeout 120000):
```bash
npm test 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Parse output for pass/fail counts. If command fails, record as "UNABLE TO RUN".

Run bash test suites if they exist:
```bash
if [[ -f "tests/e2e/run-all-e2e.sh" ]]; then
  bash tests/e2e/run-all-e2e.sh 2>&1 | tail -10
fi
```

Display:
```
Test Coverage:
  Test files: {unit} unit | {e2e} e2e | {js} JS/TS
  Results: {pass_count} passing | {fail_count} failing
  {If any failing: "  FAILING: {list of failing test names}"}
```

If tests all pass: increment `audit_passes`
If any fail: increment `audit_fails`, add to `audit_issues`

### Step 6: Colony Health Check

Display: `Checking colony health...`

**Expire stale pheromones:**
```bash
bash .aether/aether-utils.sh pheromone-expire 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Load memory metrics:**
```bash
bash .aether/aether-utils.sh memory-metrics 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

**Load instincts:**
From COLONY_STATE.json `memory.instincts`:
- Count total instincts
- Count high-confidence instincts (>= 0.7)

**Count learnings:**
From COLONY_STATE.json `memory.phase_learnings`:
- Count total learnings

**Check event log for anomalies:**
From COLONY_STATE.json `events`:
- Count total events
- Look for error events (events containing "error" or "failed")
- Look for state corruption events

**Count pheromone signals:**
```bash
bash .aether/aether-utils.sh pheromone-count 2>/dev/null || echo '{"result":{"count":0}}'
```

Display:
```
Colony Health:
  Instincts: {total} ({high_confidence} strong)
  Learnings: {learning_count}
  Pheromones: {signal_count} active
  Events: {event_count} total ({error_event_count} errors)
  {If error_event_count > 0: "  WARNING: {error_event_count} error events in log"}
```

Increment `audit_passes` (health check is informational, not pass/fail)

### Step 7: Generate Completion Report

Calculate colony age:
```bash
initialized_at=$(jq -r '.initialized_at // empty' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json)
if [[ -n "$initialized_at" ]]; then
  init_epoch=$(date -j -f "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" "$initialized_at" +%s 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  now_epoch=$(date +%s)
  if [[ "$init_epoch" -gt 0 ]]; then
    colony_age_days=$(( (now_epoch - init_epoch) / 86400 ))
  else
    colony_age_days=0
  fi
else
  colony_age_days=0
fi
```

Count phases completed:
```bash
phases_completed=$(jq '[.plan.phases[] | select(.status == "completed")] | length' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
total_phases=$(jq '.plan.phases | length' .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
```

Determine recommendation:
- If `audit_fails == 0` and `audit_warnings == 0`: `recommendation = "READY TO SEAL"`
- If `audit_fails == 0` and `audit_warnings > 0`: `recommendation = "READY TO SEAL (with warnings)"`
- If `audit_fails > 0`: `recommendation = "ISSUES TO RESOLVE"`

Write `.aether/data/completion-report.md` using the Write tool:

```markdown
# Colony Completion Report

```

**If recommendation is "READY TO SEAL":**
```
Colony ready to seal.

Report: .aether/data/completion-report.md

Next:
  /ant:seal              Seal colony at Crowned Anthill
```

**If recommendation is "READY TO SEAL (with warnings)":**
```
Colony ready to seal (with warnings).

{For each warning: "  WARNING: {description}"}

These warnings are non-blocking. You may seal or address them first.

Report: .aether/data/completion-report.md

Next:
  /ant:seal              Seal colony at Crowned Anthill
  /ant:build <phase>     Address remaining work
```

**If recommendation is "ISSUES TO RESOLVE":**
```
Issues found that should be addressed before sealing.

{For each issue with audit_fails: "  ISSUE: {description}"}

Suggested actions:
{For each issue, suggest a concrete action:}
  - Missing task evidence: Re-run the build or verify manually
  - Documentation mismatch: Update docs to match reality
  - Unresolved blockers: Run /ant:flags to review and resolve
  - Failing tests: Fix tests before sealing
  - Recurring failures: Investigate root cause via /ant:swarm

Report: .aether/data/completion-report.md

Next:
  /ant:status            Check colony status
  /ant:build <phase>     Address remaining work
  /ant:flags             Review unresolved flags
```

### Step 9: Log Activity

Run using the Bash tool:
```bash
bash .aether/aether-utils.sh activity-log "COMPLETE" "queen" "Colony audit completed - {recommendation}"
```

Display persistence confirmation:
```
All state persisted. Safe to /clear context if needed.
  Report: .aether/data/completion-report.md
  Resume: /ant:resume-colony
```

### Edge Cases

**Colony has no plan (0 phases):**
- Skip Step 2 (plan verification)
- Note: "No plan generated. Skipping plan verification."
- Recommendation defaults to "ISSUES TO RESOLVE" with note about missing plan

**Colony is still EXECUTING:**
- Warn: "Colony is still executing. Audit results may be incomplete."
- Proceed with audit anyway (do not block)

**No test files found:**
- Report: "No test files detected."
- Count as a warning, not a failure

**COLONY_STATE.json version is old (< 3.0):**
- Proceed with available fields
- Note missing fields in report as "N/A (older state format)"

**Subagent spawn fails:**
- Fall back to running the documentation checks inline
- Note the fallback in the report
