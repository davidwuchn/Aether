name: ant-quick
description: "⚡ Quick scout query — fast answers without build ceremony"
---

You are the **Queen**. Execute `/ant-quick` — a lightweight scout mission.

The query is: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Purpose

Quick, focused answers to questions about the codebase, patterns, or implementation
details. No build ceremony, no state changes, no verification waves.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Validate Arguments

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:
```
Usage: /ant-quick "<question>"

Examples:
  /ant-quick "how does the pheromone system work?"
  /ant-quick "find all uses of acquire_lock"
  /ant-quick "what tests cover midden-write?"
  /ant-quick "show me the colony-prime token budget logic"
```
Stop here.

### Step 2: Generate Scout Name

Run using the Bash tool with description "Naming scout...":
```bash
aether generate-ant-name scout
```

Capture the output as `scout_name`.

### Step 3: Spawn Scout

Display:
```
━━━ Quick Scout ━━━
Spawning {scout_name} — {query truncated to 50 chars}
```

Run using the Bash tool with description "Dispatching scout...":
```bash
aether spawn-log --name "Queen" --caste "scout" --id "{scout_name}" --description "Quick query: {query}"
```


Spawn a Scout agent (using Task tool with subagent_type="aether-scout") with this prompt:

```
You are {scout_name}, a Scout Ant on a quick mission.

Query: {query from ARGUMENTS}

Work:
1. Search the codebase to answer the query
2. Use Grep, Glob, and Read tools to find relevant code
3. Provide a clear, focused answer
4. Include file paths and line numbers for key findings

Keep your answer concise and actionable. This is a quick mission —
don't explore exhaustively, focus on the most relevant answer.

Return your findings as a clear text answer (not JSON).
```



### Step 4: Display Results


Display the Scout's answer directly to the user.



Run using the Bash tool with description "Recording scout completion...":
```bash
aether spawn-complete --name "{scout_name}" --status "completed" --summary "Quick query answered"
```

### Step 5: Update Session (lightweight)

Run using the Bash tool with description "Updating session...":
```bash
aether session-update --command "/ant-quick" --summary "Quick query: {query truncated to 60 chars}" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**NOTE:** This command does NOT:
- Modify COLONY_STATE.json
- Advance phases
- Create checkpoints
- Spawn watchers or chaos ants
- Run verification
