description: "💬 Capture clarifications before planning through the Aether CLI runtime"
---

Use the Go `aether` CLI as the source of truth.

- Execute `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether discuss $ARGUMENTS` directly.
- Do not write `pending-decisions.json`, `pheromones.json`, or `COLONY_STATE.json` by hand from this command spec.
- If the runtime returns clarification questions, present them honestly instead of inventing answers on the user's behalf.
- To persist an answer, execute `AETHER_OUTPUT_MODE=visual aether discuss --resolve <id> --answer "<choice>"`.
- If the runtime reports `discussion_status: settled`, route the user back to `aether plan`.
- If docs and runtime disagree, runtime wins.
