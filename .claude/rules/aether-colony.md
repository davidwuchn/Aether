# Aether Colony System

> This repo uses the Aether colony system for multi-agent development.
> These rules are auto-distributed by `aether update` — do not edit directly.

## Session Recovery

On the first message of a new conversation, check if `.aether/data/session.json` exists. If it does:

1. Read the file briefly to check for `colony_goal`
2. If a goal exists, display:
   ```
   Previous colony session detected: "{goal}"
   Run /ant:resume to restore context, or continue with a new topic.
   ```
3. Do NOT auto-restore — wait for the user to explicitly run /ant:resume

This only applies to genuinely new conversations, not after /clear.

## Cross-Platform Support

Aether works across three AI coding platforms:

| Platform | Commands | Agents | Format |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Claude Code | 46 slash commands (`/ant:*`) | 24 agents (`.md`) | `.claude/commands/ant/`, `.claude/agents/ant/` |
| OpenCode | 46 slash commands (`/ant:*`) | 24 agents (`.md`) | `.opencode/commands/ant/`, `.opencode/agents/` |
| Codex CLI | `aether` CLI commands | 24 agents (`.toml`) | `.codex/CODEX.md`, `.codex/agents/` |

All platforms share the same 9 worker castes and 24 agent roles. Commands in Codex use
the `aether` CLI directly (e.g., `aether pheromone-write`, `aether state-mutate`) rather
than slash commands.

## Typical Workflow

```
First time in a repo:
0. /ant:lay-eggs                           (set up Aether in this repo)

Starting a colony:
1. /ant:init "Build feature X"             (start colony with a goal)
2. /ant:colonize                           (if existing code)
3. /ant:plan                               (generates phases)
4. /ant:focus "security"                   (optional guidance)
5. /ant:build 1                            (workers execute phase 1)
6. /ant:continue                           (verify, learn, advance)
7. /ant:build 2                            (repeat until complete)
   /ant:run                                (or use autopilot for all phases)

After /clear or session break:
8. /ant:resume-colony                      (restore full context)
9. /ant:status                             (see where you left off)

After completing a colony:
10. /ant:seal                              (mark as complete)
11. /ant:entomb                            (archive to chambers)
12. /ant:init "next project goal"          (start fresh colony)
```

## Worker Castes

Workers are assigned to castes based on task type:

| Caste | Role |
|-------|------|
| builder | Implementation work |
| watcher | Monitoring, quality checks |
| scout | Research, discovery |
| chaos | Edge case testing |
| oracle | Deep research (RALF loop) |
| architect | Planning, design |
| colonizer | Codebase exploration |
| route_setter | Phase planning |
| archaeologist | Git history analysis |

The same 24 agent definitions are available across all platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex).

## Protected Paths

**Never modify these programmatically:**

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `.aether/data/` | Colony state (COLONY_STATE.json, session files) |
| `.aether/dreams/` | Dream journal entries |
| `.aether/checkpoints/` | Session checkpoints |
| `.aether/locks/` | File locks |

## Colony State

State is stored in `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json` and includes:
- Colony goal and current phase
- Task breakdown and completion status
- Parallel mode (`parallel_mode`: "in-repo" or "worktree")
- Instincts (learned patterns with confidence scores)
- Pheromone signals (FOCUS/REDIRECT/FEEDBACK)
- Event history

## Parallel Mode

Parallel mode controls how workers are isolated during builds with multiple tasks:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `in-repo` | All workers share the same repository directory (default) |
| `worktree` | Each worker gets its own git worktree for isolated file changes |

**Setting the mode:**
- During `/ant:init` — you are prompted to choose a parallel strategy
- After init — run `aether parallel-mode set <mode>` to change it

**Checking the mode:**
- `/ant:status` — colony dashboard shows the current parallel mode
- `/ant:resume` — session restore displays the parallel mode
- `aether parallel-mode get` — returns the current mode directly

## Pheromone System

Signals guide colony behavior without hard-coding instructions:
- **FOCUS** — attracts attention to an area (expires at phase end)
- **REDIRECT** — repels workers from a pattern (high priority, hard constraint)
- **FEEDBACK** — calibrates behavior based on observation (low priority)

Use FOCUS + REDIRECT before builds to steer. Use FEEDBACK after builds to adjust.

In Codex CLI, use `aether pheromone-write --type FOCUS --content "..."` instead of `/ant:focus`.
