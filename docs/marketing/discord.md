Hey everyone! Quick share of something I've been working on that I think some of you might dig.

I got tired of babysitting AI agents. You know the drill -- write a prompt, wait, tweak the prompt, wait again, fix what it broke, repeat. It felt less like having an assistant and more like herding cats.

So I built **Aether** -- an open-source multi-agent framework modeled on ant colonies. The idea is dead simple: instead of one agent trying to do everything, you get 24 specialized workers (builders, watchers, scouts, etc.) that self-organize around your goal. You communicate with them using pheromone signals instead of prompts, and they actually learn over time -- instincts compound into wisdom, which feeds a "Hive Brain" that makes the whole colony smarter the more you use it.

It's got autopilot mode too. You set a goal, go do something else, and come back to working software. 28 built-in skills, Apache 2.0 licensed, written in Go.

Install: `go install github.com/calcosmic/Aether@latest`

Honestly I'm curious -- what's your biggest frustration with current AI dev tools? Are you all-in on agents or still mostly doing things by hand?
