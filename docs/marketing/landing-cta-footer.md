# Landing Page: CTA, Footer, and Social Proof

> Structured markdown for web developer implementation.
> Tone: confident, clear, non-technical for CTAs and social proof.
> All social proof items are placeholders until real data is available.

---

## 1. Primary CTA Section (Hero / Bottom of Page)

**Layout note:** Full-width section with centered content. Dark or accent background to contrast with the main body. Should appear both below the hero and as a sticky/final section before the footer.

### Headline

> Ship software while you sleep.

### Subtext

> Aether deploys 24 specialized workers that self-organize around your goal. No prompt engineering, no babysitting. Set it up, set a goal, and let the colony build.

### Primary CTA Button

- **Label:** `Get Started -- It's Free`
- **Link:** `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether`
- **Style:** Bold, high-contrast (e.g., white text on purple/brand background). Large touch target. Slight hover animation (scale or glow).

### Secondary CTA

- **Label:** `Read the Quick Start`
- **Link:** `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether#install`
- **Style:** Outlined/ghost button. Smaller, sits beside or below the primary CTA.

### Install Command Block

```
Layout note: Monospace font, dark code block with a "copy" button.
Position: Directly below the CTA buttons, centered.
Pre-label: "Install in one line:"
```

```bash
go install github.com/calcosmic/Aether@latest
```

### Supplementary Install Options

```
Layout note: Small text below the install block, gray/muted color.
```

> No Go? Download pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether/releases).

---

## 2. Secondary CTA (Mid-Page)

**Layout note:** Positioned after the features/comparison section, before social proof. Light background, minimal. Purpose: capture visitors who are interested but not ready to install.

### Headline

> Not ready to install? Start with the docs.

### Body

> See how the colony works before you commit. The README walks through a full build -- from blank directory to shipped API -- so you can decide if Aether fits your workflow.

### CTA Button

- **Label:** `Explore the Docs`
- **Link:** `https://github.com/calcosmic/Aether#readme`
- **Style:** Outlined button, brand color border. Moderate size.

### Optional: Newsletter Signup

```
Layout note: Inline form below the CTA button. Email input + "Get updates" button.
Purpose: Capture interested visitors for launch updates.
```

- **Input placeholder:** `you@email.com`
- **Button label:** `Get Updates`
- **Privacy note (below form):** "No spam. Just updates when something ships."

## 4. Social Proof Section

**Layout note:** Positioned between the secondary CTA and the primary CTA (or above the primary CTA). Light/white background. All items are placeholders until real data exists.

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** -- This entire section should be hidden or visually de-emphasized until real social proof is available. Consider using a muted gray style or a "coming soon" label.

### 4a. Testimonials

```
Layout note: 3-column card grid on desktop, stacked on mobile.
Each card: Quote text (italic), author name, author title/org, avatar placeholder.
```

**[PLACEHOLDER] Testimonial 1:**

> "Aether changed how I approach building features. I describe what I want, and the colony figures out the implementation. The pheromone system means I never have to micromanage prompts."

-- **[PLACEHOLDER Name]**, [PLACEHOLDER Title] at [PLACEHOLDER Company]

**[PLACEHOLDER] Testimonial 2:**

> "We went from zero to a working API in a single session. The autopilot mode is unreal -- it paused when it hit something it couldn't solve, we gave it a nudge, and it finished the rest."

-- **[PLACEHOLDER Name]**, [PLACEHOLDER Title] at [PLACEHOLDER Company]

**[PLACEHOLDER] Testimonial 3:**

> "The fact that learnings carry between projects is what sold me. The colony remembers what worked last time and applies it without being asked. It genuinely gets smarter the more you use it."

-- **[PLACEHOLDER Name]**, [PLACEHOLDER Title] at [PLACEHOLDER Company]

### 4b. GitHub Stars Counter

```
Layout note: Centered badge or dynamic counter widget.
Use the GitHub API or shields.io for a live count.
```

![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/calcosmic/Aether.svg?style=social&label=Star)

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** -- Star count will update automatically via shields.io. No manual maintenance needed.

### 4c. "Trusted By" / Logo Wall

```
Layout note: Horizontal row of grayscale logos, centered.
Use max-height to keep logos uniform size.
Label above: "Used by developers at" or "Trusted by"
```

> **[PLACEHOLDER]** -- Add company/organization logos here as users adopt Aether. Recommended format: SVG logos at 120px width, grayscale filter. Minimum 3 logos before making this section visible.

**[PLACEHOLDER]** -- Logo slot 1
**[PLACEHOLDER]** -- Logo slot 2
**[PLACEHOLDER]** -- Logo slot 3
**[PLACEHOLDER]** -- Logo slot 4
**[PLACEHOLDER]** -- Logo slot 5

### 4d. Numeric Highlights (Optional)

```
Layout note: Row of 3-4 stat cards with large numbers and labels.
Position: Above testimonials, below the "Trusted by" section.
```

| Stat | Value | Label |
|------|-------|-------|
| **[PLACEHOLDER]** | `24` | Specialized workers |
| **[PLACEHOLDER]** | `28` | Built-in skills |
| **[PLACEHOLDER]** | `45` | Slash commands |
| **[PLACEHOLDER]** | `1,000+` | GitHub stars (update dynamically) |

## 6. Developer Implementation Notes

### Page Section Order (recommended)

7. Footer

### Color Palette Guidance

- **Primary brand:** Purple (#7B3FE4, used in shields.io badges)
