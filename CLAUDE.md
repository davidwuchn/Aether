## Development Workflow

### Editing System Files

| What you're changing | Where to edit | Why |
|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| workers.md | `.aether/workers.md` | Source of truth |
| aether-utils.sh | `.aether/aether-utils.sh` | Source of truth |
| utils/*.sh | `.aether/utils/` | Source of truth |
| User docs | `.aether/docs/` | Distributed directly |
| Slash commands | `.claude/commands/ant/` | Claude Code commands |
| OpenCode commands | `.opencode/commands/ant/` | OpenCode commands |
| Agent definitions | `.claude/agents/ant/` | Claude Code agents |
| Agent mirror (packaging) | `.aether/agents-claude/` | Must stay in sync with `.claude/agents/ant/` |
| OpenCode agents | `.opencode/agents/` | OpenCode worker definitions |
| Your notes | `.aether/dreams/` | Never distributed |
| Dev docs | `.aether/docs/known-issues.md` | Distributed |

### Publishing Changes

```bash
# 1. Edit files in .aether/ or .claude/commands/ant/
vim .aether/workers.md

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "your message"

# 3. Validate and push to hub
npm install -g .   # Runs validate-package.sh, then setupHub()

# 4. In other repos, pull updates
aether update      # or /ant:update
```

```

### Split Playbooks (Reliability)

High-length commands are split into smaller execution playbooks:

- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-prep.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-context.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-wave.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-verify.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/build-complete.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-verify.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-gates.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-advance.md`
- `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/continue-finalize.md`

Authority note:
- In Claude Code, `.claude/commands/ant/build.md` and `.claude/commands/ant/continue.md` are orchestrators only.
- Build/continue execution behavior is defined in `.aether/docs/command-playbooks/*.md`.
- OpenCode maintains separate command specs in `.opencode/commands/ant/*.md`.
- Agent parity model: `.claude/agents/ant/*.md` is canonical, `.aether/agents-claude/*.md` is a byte-identical packaging mirror, `.opencode/agents/*.md` maintains structural parity (same filenames/count).

## Pheromone System

User-colony communication via signals:

| Signal | Command | Priority | Use For |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| FOCUS | `/ant:focus "<area>"` | normal | "Pay attention here" |
| REDIRECT | `/ant:redirect "<avoid>"` | high | "Don't do this" (hard constraint) |
| FEEDBACK | `/ant:feedback "<note>"` | low | "Adjust based on this observation" |

**Before builds:** FOCUS + REDIRECT to steer
**After builds:** FEEDBACK to adjust
**Hard constraints:** REDIRECT (will break)
**Gentle nudges:** FEEDBACK (preferences)

**Viewing Signals:**
- `/ant:pheromones` — Full table of all active signals
- `pheromone-display` subcommand — Formatted output with strength % and decay

**Signal Injection (v1.3):**
- Colony-prime injects active signals into worker prompts via `prompt_section`
- Builder, Watcher, and Scout agents have `pheromone_protocol` sections (added Phase 4) that instruct them how to act on injected signals
- Signals are grouped by type (FOCUS, REDIRECT, FEEDBACK) in the injected prompt section

**Exchange:**
- `/ant:export-signals` — Export pheromone signals to XML for cross-colony sharing
- `/ant:import-signals` — Import pheromone signals from XML

**Automatic Suggestions:**
- `suggest-analyze` — Analyzes codebase for patterns worth capturing as pheromones
- `suggest-approve` — Tick-to-approve UI for reviewing suggestions
- Runs during build (Step 4.2) to propose contextually relevant signals

**Files:**
- `.aether/data/pheromones.json` — Active signals
- `.aether/data/constraints.json` — Focus areas and constraints (legacy, eventual deprecation)
- `.aether/docs/pheromones.md` — Full guide

---

## Quality Gates

New agents integrated into continue.md:

### Gatekeeper (Security)
- Runs after verification passes
- Scans for exposed secrets, debug artifacts
- Creates blockers if security issues found

### Auditor (Quality)
- Runs after Gatekeeper passes
- Analyzes code quality metrics
- Reports quality gate status

### Probe (Coverage)
- Analyzes test coverage gaps
- Reports coverage percentage
- Suggests additional tests

### Measurer (Performance)
- Performance analysis
- Identifies slow operations
- Reports performance metrics

---

## Midden System (Failure Tracking)

The midden tracks failures for colony learning:

- `.aether/data/midden/midden.json` — Failure records
- `midden-write` — Log a failure
- `midden-recent-failures` — Query recent failures

Failures are logged during:
- Build failures (build.md)
- Approach changes (tracked for wisdom)

**Data Maintenance:**
- `/ant:data-clean` — Remove test artifacts from colony data files (pheromones, constraints, midden)

---

## Memory Health System

Colony memory is tracked and displayed:

- `/ant:status` — Shows memory health table
- `/ant:memory-details` — Drill-down view
- `/ant:resume` — Shows memory health section

Metrics tracked:
- Events count
- Learnings count
- Instincts count
- Pheromones count
- Memory age

---

## Changelog System

Automated changelog collection:

- `changelog-append` — Append entry to CHANGELOG.md
- `changelog-collect-plan-data` — Collect plan data for changelog

---

## Milestone Names

| Milestone | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| First Mound | First runnable |
| Open Chambers | Feature work underway |
| Brood Stable | Tests consistently green |
| Ventilated Nest | Perf/latency acceptable |
| Sealed Chambers | Interfaces frozen |
| Crowned Anthill | Release ready |
| New Nest Founded | Next major version |

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify command and agent sync policy
npm run lint:sync

# Run all linters
npm run lint

# Run all tests
npm test

# Verify package before publishing
bash bin/validate-package.sh

# See what npm would package
npm pack --dry-run
```

---

## Session Freshness Detection

All stateful commands use timestamp verification to detect stale sessions:

**Pattern:**
1. Capture `SESSION_START=$(date +%s)` before spawning agents
2. Check file freshness with `session-verify-fresh --command <name>`
3. Auto-clear stale files or prompt user based on command type
4. Verify files are fresh after spawning

**Protected Commands** (never auto-clear):
- `init` — COLONY_STATE.json is precious
- `seal` — Archives are precious
- `entomb` — Chambers are precious

---

## Session Recovery

On the first message of a new conversation, check if `.aether/data/session.json` exists. If it does:

1. Read the file briefly to check for `colony_goal`
2. If a goal exists, display:
   ```
   Previous colony session detected: "{goal}"
   Run /ant:resume to restore context, or continue with a new topic.
   ```
3. Do NOT auto-restore — wait for the user to explicitly run `/ant:resume`

---

## The Core Insight

The system's pieces are now **connected**:
- Pheromones update context (colony-prime injects signals into worker prompts)
- Decisions become pheromones (auto-emit during builds)
- Learnings become instincts (observation to promotion pipeline)
- Midden affects behavior (threshold auto-REDIRECT)

**The ongoing challenge is maintenance** -- keeping documentation accurate,
data files clean, and test coverage comprehensive as features evolve.
